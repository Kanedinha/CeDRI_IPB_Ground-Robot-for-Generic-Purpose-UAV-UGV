A robust controller for the model set is designed based on μ-synthesis, and the closed-loop performance of hand shake compensation is verified experimentally on the prototypes.

Srinivasan,2017,"2017 Second International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)",IEEE Conferences,2,"In the context of power system, power system stabilizer (PSS) plays a very important role for damping low frequency oscillations. In conventional techniques, the selection of feedback controllers for PSS is usually done by the pole placement, propotinal derivative (PD), proportional integrator (PI), combination of both PD & PI, lead lag compensators etc,. These conventional control methods simply make a system stable without optimizing anything. Inview of this the researchers across the globe are working for better optimized feedback controller for PSS. This paper presents the design of such an optimized feedback control techniques with different approaches for the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) linearized phillips heffron model of power system installed with PSS. To show the effectiveness of the proposed optimized feedback controllers the experiments are conducted to cover wide range of operating conditions by choosing the loads as light, normal & heavy.

For the application of mobile devices, geometry size of the mechanism is extremely limited. However, the larger the size of yoke that covers the magnetic field is, the better uniformity it will perform. This study, therefore, is dedicated to conduct an optimal design with the coupled relationship between magnetic field and mechanical geometry.

However, to guarantee that the reference joint trajectory will produce a safe movement despite modeling errors and perturbations, a stabilizer needs to be implemented on the robot. Though this stabilizer constitutes an essential part of the control strategy of most advanced humanoid platform, it is usually not open-source and dedicated to the own robot characteristics. The goal of this paper is to propose a general and practical strategy for designing a stabilizer for joint-position controlled humanoid robots. The proposed method is based on a double inverted pendulum model and a decoupling approach thanks to which the position of the ZMP and the center of gravity can be controlled independently through the regulation of the ankle and hip joints. The stabilizer generates the expected stabilizing torques from the admissible joint position input. The resulting control algorithm is fast and can be easily executed on the robot. This algorithm was successfully implemented as real-time plugins for the OpenHRP simulator of the HRP2.

This article explains a method to analyze the effect of space charge on tree initiation. Crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) composite samples with different contents of voltage stabilizer were prepared. The electrical tree inception voltage of each sample was measured with the needle-plate electrode. The space charge distribution characteristics of the composites were measured by a pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) system with an extremely fast pulse burst under ac. In addition, trap distribution characteristics were studied by the isothermal surface potential decay (ISPD) method. The results show that the voltage stabilizer inhibited tree initiation, and the optimum content was 0.5 wt%. The detected space charge near the electrodes decreased significantly from the voltage stabilizer, and the traps induced by the voltage stabilizer were inferred to be the main reason. In addition, it was confirmed that the calculated average bulk charge density had a negative correlation with the tree inception voltage, which could be a supporting datum for the ac tree initiation mechanism.",AC voltage;electrical tree;space charge;trap energy;voltage stabilizer,,"National Industry-Education Platform of Energy Storage, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"

In this paper, it has been equipped with a PUMA type manipulator which gives to the proposed robot the capability of object manipulation.

So, a 2 DOF stabilizing pendulum is used to help the stability of a system and make the manipulator practical. As a result, dynamics equations of the assumed mobile robot are presented.

The main utility of the estimated speed is in the power system stabilizer. The paper briefly reviews the problems associated with the existing methods for reliable and accurate rotor speed measurement or estimation. It is shown that the existing methods of rotor speed estimation have some severe drawbacks and may cause the power system stabilizer to operate suboptimal or even produce negative damping over a specific frequency range when an inaccurate rotor speed signal is used as the input to the power system stabilizer. Most importantly it demonstrates that a system equipped with it behaves as predicted in simulations, especially when examining inter-area modes. The new rotor speed estimation method was implemented on an industrial control platform and integrated in a modern digital excitation system. A series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations were run to examine the properties of the new speed estimator.

In order to create a sturdy and stable platform for pavement, soil modification and stabilization with combined ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), carbide lime (CL) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was employed in this study. Mix proportion parameters of stabilized soils are analyzed by using the Taguchi's experiment design methodology for optimal design. Results show that OPC and GGBFS content play significant roles for the early strength and long-term strength of stabilized soil, respectively; whereas CL has an optimum content of 9% at the initial stages. Maximum unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 1.61 and 2.32 MPa were achieved, respectively, at the optimum conditions of 4%GGBFS/6%CL//3.2%OPC at the curing age of 7 and 28 days. Splitting tensile strength (STS) increases rapidly with curing ages and reaches 0.45-0.48 MPa at the age of 56d. More dosage of carbide lime can help to the long-term strength. The GGBFS/CL/OPC-stabilized soil has a high durability. After 10 wet-dry cycles the strength loss ratio remains within 10%; after 10 freeze-thaw cycles the weight loss is below 8%. California bearing ratio (CBR) was conducted on the soil alone and the soil-stabilizer mixture. CBR ranging between 158 and 224 were obtained for the 7 days curing, whereas the silt typically has CBR less than 3.1 in its wet state. Field test was also conducted during construction using Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) to assess the strength of stabilized soil in situ. DCP test indicated that the strength development of GGBFS/CL/OPC stabilized subgrade is more rapid and the improvement of subgrade bearing capacity can facilitate an increase in compaction degree of subbase..",pavement;wet subgrade;high groundwater table;silt;soil stabilization;industry by-product;ground granulated blast furnace slag;carbide lime,,"Chang'an University, Xian, Shanxi, CN; Commun.

Eastwood; G. Matheou,2016,2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,12,"The Airborne Methane Plume Spectrometer (AMPS) is a mature instrument concept that is ready for development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). At its core is a novel high-resolution imaging spectrometer that records solar reflected light between 1.99 and 2.42 pm at 1 nm resolution, including strong methane (CH4) bands in the short-wave infrared. The push-broom spectrometer will leverage recent advancements in grating design and large-format 2D focal plane arrays to enable - for the first time - the high spectral resolution necessary for trace gas retrievals combined with high-performance imaging capabilities developed for surface remote sensing. AMPS features a 36° field of view with 600 resolved spatial elements across track (1 mRad) and 431 pixels in the spectral dimension. All other aspects of the instrument, such as the telescope, cryo-cooler, image stabilizer, GPS, are identical to available airborne JPL spectrometers in operation. The AMPS design is based on the next generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG), which has been used for high resolution mapping of CH4 concentrations from a controlled release experiment [1] and over existing natural gas fields [2]. A real time CH4 plume detection capability originally developed for AVIRIS-NG and successfully demonstrated over oil fields [3] will also be implemented with AMPS. This will facilitate surveys over existing oil and gas fields to identify and attribute CH4 emissions to individual point source locations, permit adaptive surveys with repeat imaging of suspected sources, and allow real time communication to site operators or ground crews equipped with additional instruments to verify observed plumes. AMPS will enable quantitative imaging of CH4 plumes at unprecedented spatial resolution and precision. Using a slow moving platform such as a helicopter at 100 m flight altitude (60 m image swath) will permit imaging CH4 enhancements at 10 cm spatial resolution and an unprecedented accuracy of 0.05 g CH4/m2. This will allow robust detection of CH4 emissions as low as 0.17 m3/h (6 standard cubic feet per hour), an order of magnitude smaller than what current airborne systems can detect. Using fixed-wing aircraft, AMPS can also be flown faster and higher (1 to 8 km flight altitude), thereby providing larger image swaths (0.6 to 4.8 km swaths respectively) and effective large scale surveys. Mapping CH4 emissions to individual point source locations could allow site operators to identify and mitigate these emissions, which reflect both a potential safety hazard and lost revenue. For the regulatory and scientific communities, understanding the distribution (spatial, temporal) and size of these emissions is of interest given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic emissions, including industrial point source emissions and fugitive CH4 from oil and gas infrastructure.",,,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"

Kim,2013,IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,IEEE Journals,2,"In this paper, a unified media application processor (UMAP) is presented for 2D/3D image analysis/synthesis applications on handheld devices. UMAP integrates parallel and sequential processing layers which consist of heterogeneous functional IPs for general media contents processing on today's application processors (AP). Based on the heterogeneous many-core platform, UMAP supports not only graphics and vision processing for real-time augmented reality (AR) but also disparity estimation and 3D display synthesis for 3D-view AR acceleration. A new concept of 3D-view AR which synthesizes 3D display contents from two vertically aligned stereo images and a self-constructed disparity map is introduced to achieve true realism for next generation mobile devices. For low-cost 3D-view AR processing, a homography-based disparity estimation (HDE) algorithm is proposed to construct a disparity map between two stereo images with small implementation overhead. For real-time and energy-efficient system organization, workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture and a mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) are also implemented in UMAP. The 3-stage pipelined system which consists of graphics, vision, and display operation stages reduces per-frame execution latency, while dynamic analog/digital mode reconfiguration based on mixed-mode FEE reduces per-frame energy dissipation, so real-time energy-efficient 3D-view AR can be realized in UMAP. FEE performs high-speed corner detection for vision processing based on four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCLs). Especially, a diode-connected current sensing stabilizer (CSS) in each CCL reduces minimum sensing current for corner detection, so average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In 2D or 3D-view AR processing, FEE with four CCLs replaces the parallel processing core cluster which is the most power hungry IP in UMAP, so 96.7% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved in real operation.

458,On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other,S. Haykin; J. M. Fuster,2014,Proceedings of the IEEE,IEEE Journals,62,"Cognitive dynamic systems provide a broadly defined platform, whereby engineering learns from cognitive neuroscience, and by the same token, cognitive neuroscience learns from engineering. The first part of the paper is of a tutorial nature, addressing recent advances in cognitive perception and cognitive control, which are the dual of each other. The study of cognitive perception, viewed from the perspective of Bayesian inference, starts with sparse coding, well known in neuroscience. However, sparse coding could become ill-posed, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such situations, stability is a necessary requirement, which can only be satisfied if there is sufficient information in the observables. To satisfy this requirement, the sparse-coding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information filtering (i.e., a special case of Bayesian filtering). Accordingly, the performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of perceptual attention. This improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor to separate relevant information from irrelevant information. Next, moving into cognitive control, viewed from the perspective of Bellman's dynamic programming, two ideas are exploited: entropic state of the perceptor, and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two entropic states, namely, the current state and its immediate past value. The net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of Bellman's dynamic programming, and, therefore, a new reinforcement learning algorithm, which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, but also offers some highly desirable properties. Among them is a linear law of computational complexity, which is the best that it could be. The second part of the paper addresses two challenging problems: first, how to mediate between cognitive control and cognitive perception and, second, how to formulate a procedure for risk control. The first problem is resolved by making use of probabilistic reasoning, a branch of probability theory, which leads into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine. With this mediation in place, the conditions for overall system stability are derived, thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the overall system stabilizer. The second challenge is risk control, which is by far the most challenging of them all: In the presence of an unexpected disturbance in the environment, risk is brought under control by mimicking the predict and preadapt function, which is considered to be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. To be specific, motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new preadaptive control mechanism, which involves two different sets of actions: One set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy in the motor control. The other set involves a window of experiences (i.e., optimal actions) gained in the past. In a novel way, by exploiting these two sets, we end up with a preadaptive control mechanism in the form of a closed-loop feedback structure, which brings with it control (executive) attention.",Attention;cognition;control;entropic state;intelligence;memory;perception;pre-adaptation;prediction;risk control;self-organization;system stability,,"Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada; Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA"

Kirschen,2020,2020 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM),IEEE Conferences,0,"For decades, power system stabilizers paired with high initial response automatic voltage regulators have served as an effective means of meeting sometimes conflicting system stability requirements. Driven primarily by increases in power electronically-coupled generation and load, the dynamics of large-scale power systems are rapidly changing. Electric grids are losing inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. The system load is becoming stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In parallel, advancements in wide-area measurement technology have made it possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted over long distances in nearly real time. In this paper, we present a power system stabilizer architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the standard $\Delta \omega -$ type stabilizer. The control strategy utilizes a real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from wide-area measurements. This approach creates a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response, making synchronous generators better able to adapt to changes in system dynamics. The phenomena of interest are examined using a two-area test case and a reduced-order model of the North American Western Interconnection. To validate the key findings under realistic conditions, we employ a state-of-the-art co-simulation platform to combine high-fidelity power system and communication network models.

With the electric propellers fixed at the leading wing edge, the tailsitter has two standard surfaces for elevation control and two vertical stabilizers that are used to give the necessary direction on vertical takeoff and landing. We have designed, built, and tested a prototype based on this new double-hybrid concept, which spends less energy on vertical taking off and landing and also on horizontal flight, thus maximizing flight endurance and travelled distance. We performed several experimental tests starting with the aircraft on the ground in vertical positioning. These tests include executing vertical takeoffs and landing, transitions from vertical to horizontal flight modes and transitions back (from horizontal to vertical), and hovering, which were carried out successfully. Transitions fourth and back from combustion to multirotor are inherent to some of those flight mode transitions, which have also been performed smoothly. We also performed tests (in bench) to estimate the maximum flight duration, which has demonstrated about 32 minutes of endurance.

Instead of dissipating the energy as heat, the regenerative electric energy from the motor drives can be stored in energy storage elements such as flywheels, ultra-capacitors and batteries. Using the Simcaps toolbox, an aileron model with the electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) is developed in Matlab/Simulink. This regenerative power system consisting of a synchronous generator, three-phase-to dc boost rectifier, EMA including an input filter, ESE and a bidirectional dc-dc converter interfacing with ESE is presented. A single-phase half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter is used in this configuration. Two power management control strategies are applied in this simulation study, load-leveling and load-following procedures. In both strategies, ESE compensates for the difference between the electric drive requirements and the power provided by power distribution bus.

A Ballbot is an underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. It is as tall as human height until could interact by people whereas a Ballbot has not been equipped with a manipulator for grasping objects. In this paper, it has been equipped with a PUMA type manipulator which gives to the proposed robot the capability of object manipulation. Because of passive joints, Ballbot cannot maintain stability and following desired end-effector trajectory. So, a 2 DOF stabilizing pendulum is used to help the stability of a system and make the manipulator practical. As a result, dynamics equations of the assumed mobile robot are presented.

474,A Generalized PSS Architecture for Balancing Transient an Small-Signal Response,R. Elliott; P. Arabshahi; D. Kirschen,2020,2020 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM),IEEE Conferences,0,"For decades, power system stabilizers paired with high initial response automatic voltage regulators have served as an effective means of meeting sometimes conflicting system stability requirements. Driven primarily by increases in power electronically-coupled generation and load, the dynamics of large-scale power systems are rapidly changing. Electric grids are losing inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. The system load is becoming stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In parallel, advancements in wide-area measurement technology have made it possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted over long distances in nearly real time. In this paper, we present a power system stabilizer architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the standard $\Delta \omega -$ type stabilizer. The control strategy utilizes a real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from wide-area measurements. This approach creates a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response, making synchronous generators better able to adapt to changes in system dynamics. The phenomena of interest are examined using a two-area test case and a reduced-order model of the North American Western Interconnection. To validate the key findings under realistic conditions, we employ a state-of-the-art co-simulation platform to combine high-fidelity power system and communication network models. The benefits of the proposed control strategy are retained even under pessimistic assumptions of communication network performance.",,,"Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington; Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington; Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington"

Kim; L. -S. Kim,2013,IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,IEEE Journals,2,"In this paper, a unified media application processor (UMAP) is presented for 2D/3D image analysis/synthesis applications on handheld devices. UMAP integrates parallel and sequential processing layers which consist of heterogeneous functional IPs for general media contents processing on today's application processors (AP). Based on the heterogeneous many-core platform, UMAP supports not only graphics and vision processing for real-time augmented reality (AR) but also disparity estimation and 3D display synthesis for 3D-view AR acceleration. A new concept of 3D-view AR which synthesizes 3D display contents from two vertically aligned stereo images and a self-constructed disparity map is introduced to achieve true realism for next generation mobile devices. For low-cost 3D-view AR processing, a homography-based disparity estimation (HDE) algorithm is proposed to construct a disparity map between two stereo images with small implementation overhead. For real-time and energy-efficient system organization, workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture and a mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) are also implemented in UMAP. The 3-stage pipelined system which consists of graphics, vision, and display operation stages reduces per-frame execution latency, while dynamic analog/digital mode reconfiguration based on mixed-mode FEE reduces per-frame energy dissipation, so real-time energy-efficient 3D-view AR can be realized in UMAP. FEE performs high-speed corner detection for vision processing based on four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCLs). Especially, a diode-connected current sensing stabilizer (CSS) in each CCL reduces minimum sensing current for corner detection, so average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In 2D or 3D-view AR processing, FEE with four CCLs replaces the parallel processing core cluster which is the most power hungry IP in UMAP, so 96.7% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved in real operation.

Furthermore, in order to control the orientation of the quadrotor, a robust nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) is developed for the attitude subsystem. The proposed control scheme enables the quadrotor to hover with an excellent transient state, high accuracy, and small settling time. Finally, simu-lation results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed scheme.",Hovering control;Fractional order sliding mode control;nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control;Quadrotor,,"Systems Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia; Systems Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia; Systems Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia"
531,Effect of Horizontal Plate Length on Working Resistance of Blade under Different Cutting Rake Angles,Y. He; P. Lu; L. Guo; W. Wu,2020,2020 5th International Conference on Electromechanical Control Technology and Transportation (ICECTT),IEEE Conferences,1,"Working resistance of blades is influenced remarkably by cutting rake angle during soil cutting and bulldozing process. In order to further reduce the effect of the working resistance on soil cutting and bulldozing, the blades with horizontal plates in three different lengths were developed. Self-designed experiment system was used to carry out soil cutting and bulldozing. Twelve groups of soil cutting and bulldozing tests were completed with four different cutting rake angles under cutting depth of 90mm in grading soil. The results show that the blades with horizontal plates can reduce the working resistance when the cutting rake angle is greater than a certain valve. There is more significant effect on the working resistance when the soil cutting and bulldozing are under larger cutting rake angles, and it would be have adverse influence when the cutting rake angle is less than 45 degree. In addition, the length of the horizontal plate has an optimal value to minimize the working resistance under different cutting rake angles. Therefore, it is a feasible way to reduce the working resistance by designing the blades with horizontal plates for earthmoving machine under certain conditions.",working resistance;blade;horizontal plate;soil cutting;bulldozing,,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China; Key Laboratory of Road Construction & Equipment of MOE, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China; Key Laboratory of Road Construction & Equipment of MOE, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China"

The synthesis of the quadrotor control system based on the parametrization of all stabilizing H-infinity static output feedback is presented.

Conventional PPM EMATs typically generate waves which simultaneously propagate both forward and backward. This can complicate the received signals and make it difficult to locate the position of scatterers. Unidirectional generation of ultrasounds can be achieved if two ultrasonic sources are separated by a predefined distance and are excited with the proper delay. Relying on this principle, EMATs have been previously designed aiming to generate other modes of ultrasonic waves. The main challenge when extending this conception to an SH-wave EMAT is how to restrict each coil to its specific magnet array. We present the concept of a unidirectional SH EMAT consisting of two racetrack coils and two interlaced PPM arrays, that are slightly shifted sideways, in such a way that the generated wavefronts still properly interfere.

In this study, the authors present a decentralized behavior-based formation flight control that is capable to fly a group of quadrotors in an unknown environment avoiding obstacles and collisions between quadrotors. This objective is achieved by summing the weighted output of three behaviors, which are separation adjustment, trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, and sending the resulting control commands to the motors of each quadrotor. Using a cyclic directed graph topology, where each quadrotor makes use of the information of one of its neighbors, each connected pair of quadrotors maintain a specified separation.

At first, we established the linear parameter varying model of this maglev system. Then, the control strategy is designed, which consists of a zero-power horizontal levitation controller and rotation controller. The levitation control is realized by introducing feedback of integral current and deviation of air gap in the proportional-derivative control system. The rotation controller employs a centroid observer and centroid Jacobian. It outputs the rotating angle at the demand of the zero-power and horizontal levitation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed maglev system has a better zero power and horizontal levitation performance than without rotary magnets.

The oil bladder structure of Argo float is adopted in the vertical plane of the OB-AUV, and the balance is maintained by the buoyancy, and the horizontal plane is coordinated by two thrusters. In the proposed FSM controller, the gain of sliding mode control rate is obtained by adjusting the speed error and heading angle error through fuzzy control. According to the kinematics model, an OB-AUV FSM trajectory tracking control system in the horizontal plane is built. In the state of static water and ocean wave, the PID, the SM and FSM trajectory tracking control are simulated and analyzed respectively, and the OB-AUV obstacle avoidance simulation is added.

A tri Tilt rotor UAV is a combination of vertical flight performance of a helicopter and forward flight capability of an aircraft. The front two rotors are used to tilt from the horizontal position to the vertical and vice versa, and the third middle rotor is placed in the aft of centerline of fuselage with a lesser angle. UAVs can be classified into two main types, i.e., fixed-wing UAVs and VTOL UAVs. The mathematical model of the Tri Tilt rotor UAV using force and moment equations are derived for vertical take-off to horizontal flight and vice-versa using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The development of self-guided and fully autonomous UAVs would result in reducing the risk to human life.

However, this structure produces too much vibration which leads to system failure. To overcome this drawback, this project developed an intelligent vibration controller based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and incorporated into a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. BFO is a metaheuristic approach categorized as an evolutionary algorithm recently developed, and a nature-inspired optimization algorithm. BFO has been successfully applied to solve some engineering problems due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. Therefore, by introducing BFO to the PID controller, the desired parameters to control vibration experienced by a horizontal flexible plate can be easily found. The performance of the intelligent PID controller was compared to the conventional tuning method known as Ziegler-Nichols (ZN). It was noticed that the PID controller tuned by BFO successfully outperformed the PID controller tuned by ZN by achieving a high attenuation at the first mode of vibration of 44.65 dB as compared to the latter which was only attenuated at the first mode of vibration at 12.8 dB.

Efficient management of cloud resources is crucial in order to provide high quality services and applications. In this work we present a novel method for scaling cloud resources and provide stability guarantees. We do this by leveraging ideas and concepts from classic control theory, namely mid-range control and combine horizontal scaling and vertical scaling in a novel way. Horizontal scaling is typically when one adds/removes whole unites of resources (e.g., virtual machines or containers), while vertical scaling is when one grows/shrinks already allocated resources (e.g., making a deployed virtual machine larger/smaller). Each methods has their own trade-offs: i) horizontal scaling is often slow and coarse-grained, but can scale over a large range, and ii) vertical scaling is often quick and smooth, but has limited range.The proposed algorithm is called HoloScale, which leverages the strengths of both scaling mechanisms, without the drawbacks. The method is capable of scaling smoothly, quickly, and over a large range. By using core concepts from control theory, we show that systems managed by the HoloScale algorithm are stable in the presence of time-varying scaling delays.",cloud computing;scaling;control theory;horizontal scaling;vertical scaling,,"Ericsson, Sweden; Ericsson, Sweden"

This study aimed to investigate the directed connectivity in large-scale brain networks for precision grip force control. Eight healthy volunteers participated in the experiment. Totally 32 channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded during a precision grip task that requires accurate force control following a dynamically changed visual target.

Results showed relatively higher rHVG-TE values in the posterior brain region but lower rHVG-TE values in the anterior brain region within the whole spectrum (4-70Hz), indicating a posterior-to-anterior information flow. This study revealed that the activation of posterior region is higher than the anterior region.

In particular, the wind's uncertain nature can lead to undesired electromechanical effects, which in turn decrease power generation efficiency and, in extreme cases, could also be the cause of irreparable damage to the system itself. This letter presents a robust controller that allows the fraction of captured wind energy to be kept while maintaining the transient loads in safe values and preserves electricity generation inside its nominal values in Region III. A linear plus a non-homogeneous quasi-continuous second-order sliding-mode control is proposed to supply energy into the system to maintain the desired power and reject the undesired electromechanical effects.

It is one of the biggest reliability challenges in the usage of electronic devices and several safety critical applications. In embedded systems, soft errors often cause failure in run time. Embedded system which has high complexity is vulnerable to soft errors. In a consolidated memory bit-cell area, one bit upset that can ruin a solitary bit-cell can now corrupt the contiguous regions also. A large number of bit upsets happen when data is passed starting with one end then onto the next. To address this issue, several techniques are introduced to detect multiple errors and increase the rectification rate. To ensure against soft errors, a high level process for identification and correction of errors of has been proposed. The method is known as HVD7Q (Horizontal-Vertical-Diagonal-7-Queen-Parity).

The optimal cable length is commanded by an automatic winch that retracts/releases the cable forming a catenary curve shape between the ground station and the aerial vehicle. This automatic procedure allows to reduce the disturbances in the vehicle since over-tensions in the cable are avoided.

639,Stochastic response control of 2D jacket structure using MR damper,S. Jothinathan; D. Kumar,2021,OCEANS 2021: San Diego – Porto,IEEE Conferences,0,"The jacket structure is one of the most important structures in the offshore industry. It is mainly installed in relatively shallow water conditions. The jacket structures are subjected to continuous wave forces, which severely affect the life of the offshore platform. Generally, the jacket structures are designed such that their response is small under its environmental loads, but it also increases the cost. So, controlling its response is a good alternative to increase its life span. In this study, a 2D jacket structure in a water depth of 120m is studied for its response control using Magneto-Rheological damper (MR damper). MR dampers have been successfully implemented in semi-active control of civil structures. They have been well proven in controlling the structural responses subjected to multiple frequency excitations. The MR damper's semi-active control algorithm requires the calculation of optimal force by assuming the structure to be linear. This optimal force can be obtained using various methods, and one such widely used method is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) strategy. The ocean waves are random, and hence the stochastic LQR Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) has to be used to compute the optimal control force on the structure. This optimal force calculated can further be used by the MR damper's semi-active control algorithm to obtain the controlled response. From the theory of the LQG method, the input excitation has to be a white noise process, but the ocean waves that excite the offshore platforms are a narrow band process. So, the spectral content of the input excitation is captured using the shaping filters. The shaping filters are designed to obtain the required narrow banded spectrum of the water particle kinematics at different points of the structure. The filters are designed such that the cross-correlation of the excitation at various offshore platform points is maintained. The Cholesky factorization of the spectral matrix at various grid points degenerates the problem into a single input multiple output problem. Thus, individual fitting of the factorized spectral matrix components is sufficient to obtain the correct cross-correlation along with the depth. The 2D jacket requires the water particle kinematics to be calculated at different horizontal locations also. This horizontal propagation problem requires developing an ‘All-Pass’ filter, which allows one to design the phase shift at different frequency components while maintaining the unit magnitude transfer function. The developed filter equations are then augmented to the original jacket structure, and LQR gains are computed for the stochastic regulator problem. A Kalman filter is designed, and the state estimate is obtained for each time step, which is further used in the calculation of the optimal force. It is shown that stochastic structural control works for an offshore structure like the jacket, and control efficiencies and limitations under various conditions are discussed.",offshore jacket;Control;MR damper;Filters;LQG control,,"Department of Ocean Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India; Department of Ocean Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"
640,Synergetic Control of the Mobile Self-Balanced Robot,S. Podvalny; E. Vasiljev,2019,2019 XXI International Conference Complex Systems: Control and Modeling Problems (CSCMP),IEEE Conferences,0,"This article is devoted to an automatic motion control of the mobile self-balanced robot installed on a two-wheeled gyroscopic platform. The traditional solution of this task is to generate the control action for the engines of the wheels that would combine the stabilization process of horizontal position of the platform and its movement along the preset trajectory. Generally, when the frequency division or phase separation of these processes is impossible, then the position control and control of robot's motion interfere and exert the mutual perturbating effect. This influence is caused by kinematic and dynamic interrelations of coordinates of the mechanical system which is balancing freely on the mobile axis: any attempt to start movement or to deviate from the uniform rectilinear motion is accompanied inevitably with the deviation of the robot's longitudinal axis whereas any inclination of the platform leads to the emergence of the torques which move the platform on the surface of rolling. Any intention to suppress the internal interdependence of the coordinates of the system leads to further complication of control algorithms which requires considerable energy resources, viz., the overestimated power of engines and the capacities of storage batteries. To eliminate these fundamental shortcomings the synergetic approach is offered realizing the control of the considered system, i.e. to enter an additional minor operating influence - the position of the center of mass of a system. Working off this influence is carried out by the intrinsic kinematic and dynamic interrelations of the coordinates of a platform. As a result the system movement arises providing the matched solution for both the stabilization of the platform position and its coplanar motion. The two-member return pendulum kinematic scheme with the slowed-down hinge between the links was used for simulation and implementation of this control mode. The motion of the system's center of mass is realized in the form of angular deviation of the top link of a pendulum to the required angle. The mathematical model was built on the basis of the Lagrange's equations for kinetic energy of a system in the generalized coordinates in the form of two nonlinear differential equations of the second order. The center of masses position is entered to these equations in the form of a parameter. Indistinct regulators for each channel of regulation are synthesized and the operability test results of the offered automatic motion control are presented.",synergetic control;mobile robots;motion control of masses center,,"Voronezh State Technical University, Voronezh, Russia; Voronezh State Technical University, Voronezh, Russia"

Yan,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,IEEE Journals,2,"Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used in two-dimensional (2D) navigation robotic devices, such as brain-controlled wheelchairs and brain-controlled vehicles. However, contemporary BCI systems are driven by binary selective control. On the one hand, only directional information can be transferred from humans to machines, such as “turn left” or “turn right”, which means that the quantified value, such as the radius of gyration, cannot be controlled. In this study, we proposed a spatial gradient BCI controller and corresponding environment coordinator, by which the quantified value of brain commands can be transferred in the form of a 2D vector, improving the flexibility, stability and efficiency of BCIs. Methods: A horizontal array of steady-state visual stimulation was arranged to excite subject (EEG) signals. Covariance arrays between subjects’ electroencephalogram (EEG) and stimulation features were mapped into quantified 2-dimensional vectors. The generated vectors were then inputted into the predictive controller and fused with virtual forces generated by the robot's predictive environment coordinator in the form of vector calculation. The resultant vector was then interpreted into the driving force for the robot, and real-time speed feedback was generated. Results: The proposed SGC controller generated a faster (27.4 s vs. 34.9 s) response for the single-obstacle avoidance task than the selective control approach. In practical multiobstacle tasks, the proposed robot executed 39% faster in the target-reaching tasks than the selective controller and had better robustness in multiobstacle avoidance tasks (average failures significantly dropped from 27% to 4%). Significance: This research proposes a new form of brain-machine shared control strategy that quantifies brain commands in the form of a 2-D control vector stream rather than selective constant values. Combined with a predictive environment coordinator, the brain-controlled strategy of the robot is optimized and provided with higher flexibility.

First, a nonlinear mathematical model for the faulty quadrotor is derived with three control inputs and six outputs, which includes the translational and rotational dynamics. Because of the limited inputs, the controllability of the yaw state is sacrificed, and the control inputs are reallocated to the other three healthy rotors. Second, a nonlinear controller is designed based on the proposed model. This presented controller includes two subcontrollers: 1) a roll angle, pitch angle, and altitude subcontroller and 2) a horizontal position subcontroller. In the controller design, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the coefficient matrix is applied to overcome the singularity of the roll angle.

The development of wind power has continuously exceeded its expected development speed and has maintained the status of the world’s fastest-growing energy source. To ensure the stable and efficient conversion of wind energy by wind turbines, not only depends on the reliability of the wind power generation equipment itself, but also the wind turbine control system is also an important factor for the wind energy conversion system, or even become a long-term safe and reliable operation of the wind farm. Therefore, the control system has become a research hotspot. The key to the efficient and stable operation of the entire wind energy conversion system is control technology, including yaw control, pitch angle control, and maximum power point tracking control. The active yaw control system is one of the important components of the horizontal axis wind turbine control system. To eliminate the uncertainty of the influence of wind direction on turbine power, this paper verifies a composite yaw control system. Through an active yaw system and maximum power point tracking system, the turbine position and rotation speed are adjusted to enable the wind turbine to accurately track the wind direction, capture wind energy to the greatest extent.

Three types of possibly fast time-varying but bounded uncertainty are considered: system modeling error, external disturbance and road excitation. The uncertainty bounds are not necessary to be known. First, the pointing tracking system is constructed as a coupled, nonlinear and uncertain dynamical system with two interconnected (horizontal and vertical) subsystems. Second, a tracking error  $e$  is defined as a gauge of control objective, and then the dynamical equation of the pointing tracking system is built in state-space form. Third, for uncertainty control, a comprehensive uncertainty bound  $\alpha $  is derived to measure the most conservative influence of the uncertainty, and then an adaptive law is proposed to evaluate it in real time. Finally, for pointing tracking control, an adaptive robust control is proposed to render the pointing tracking system to be practically stable; thereout, the objective of pointing tracking is achieved.

656,Aerodynamic Performance of a Quadrotor MAV Considering the Horizontal Wind,Y. Lei; H. Wang,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,10,"The aerodynamic performance of the quadrotor is usually suffering a lower propulsive efficiency in a windy environment. Especially the horizontal wind may affect the attitude control to provide sufficient thrust to lift the entire vehicle or cause extra power consumption. In this paper, the aerodynamic characteristics of a micro quadrotor aircraft considering the horizontal wind disturbance are studied by both experiments and simulations. First, the aerodynamic model of the quadrotor with the influence of horizontal wind disturbance is deviated in details. Then, the distribution of flow field of the quadrotorr MAV considering the effects of horizontal wind was simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Finally, the thrust and power consumption of quadrotor with rotational speed ranged from 1500 to 2300 r/min were obtained in a low-speed wind tunnel. The comparison of simulation and experimental results shows that the distribution of flow field becomes more complicated with mutual interferences resulted by the distortion of rotor wake and crash of the downwash flow from the front rotors along with the wind direction. The thrust of the rotors gradually increases with wind speed, resulting from the increment of pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces. However, the power consumption is also increasing because of the possible vibration caused by the strong interactions when the wind speed is up to 4.0 m/s. Also, the power loading of the quadrotor is larger at 2.5 m/s, which shows a good wind resistance with a better aerodynamic performance.",Quadrotor;horizontal wind;adjacent rotors;aerodynamic interference;wind tunnel tests;numerical simulation,,"School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China; School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"

Moreover, the actuators in practice cannot be ideal, and the existence of input dead zones will introduce much challenge during the controller design process. To improve the working efficiency, payload hoisting/lowering movement is necessary during the trolley horizontal movement, which implies that the rope length is variable and makes the entire system more complex. To solve these problems, an adaptive fuzzy control law is proposed for the double pendulum crane with variable rope lengths in this article, which can regulate the trolley displacement and rope length to the corresponding desired values within finite time and simultaneously suppress the hook’s swing and payload’s swing. Specifically, fuzzy logic systems are introduced with carefully designed adaptive laws to compensate for input dead zones for the double pendulum crane. Next, an effective regulation control method is proposed, and the convergence of actuated state variables, i.e., the trolley displacement and the rope length, is analyzed and proven by rigorous mathematical analysis. Then, the elimination of the hook’s swing and payload’s swing is further proven by using the property of the converging input bounded state.

In this paper, a stable control strategy is proposed based on model reduction and energy attenuation to realize the position control for the planar AAPA manipulator. First, the dynamics model of the system is built, and the control process is divided into two stages to realize the control objective. In stage 1, the first two links move to the target angles which can ensure the target position is in the reachable area of the system. Meanwhile, based on the energy attenuation, the third link converges to an intermediate attitude angle. Then, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed to optimize the target angles for last two links, which satisfy the angle constraint. In stage 2, the angles of the first and second links remain unchanged, that is the system is reduced to a virtual planar Acrobot, and then the third and fourth links move to the target value to realize the control objective.

A stable nonlinear guidance law, which is a function of the inertial positions and velocities of the UAV and the predefined path, is designed using Lyapunov stability arguments. The concept of the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) technique was applied to optimize a key parameter of the guidance law to improve the performance of the controller (PFC_NMPC), where the stability of the relative nonlinear system is maintained. The proposed method was verified in the MATLAB/Simulink environment to realize following the straight-line, square and circular paths. The path- following performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the guidance laws with parameter fixed (PFC) or tuned by fuzzy logic (PFC_FL). With the predictive ability, the proposed method can make the UAV fly more on the desired square and circular paths than the other two methods, PFC and PFC_FL.

With no labeled data in target domain, the performance may have a significant drop. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cross-domain adaptive person re-identification framework based on horizontal pyramid similarity learning (UHPS). Firstly, horizontal pyramid features are extracted by dividing the deep feature maps into different number of partial feature bins. These feature bins with diverse scales can incorporate not only the global information but also local information in different spatial scales, making the framework more robust in complex environment. Then, horizontal pyramid similarity learning is proposed with the mechanism of fusing together the internal similarity of the target domain and the similarity between the source domain and target domain. Finally, the unsupervised clustering algorithm DBSCAN embeded with the horizontal pyramid similarity is employed to select training data in the target domain and estimate the pseudo labels in each training iteration, for the purpose of adapting the framework to the target domain.

In this system the automatic control of interconnected electric drives ensures the formation of electromechanical torsion to maintain a closed state of backlash in the kinematic transmission in a given range of load torque variation. When the value of load torque is exited from the set range, it is automatically distributed equally among the electric drives. The application of results for position control of the horizontal axis of an antenna installation is illustrated, because its load torque is active, alternating and depends on the lifting angle, that is well considered with mechanical characteristics of developed control system. When crossing the vertical, load torque of this mechanism changes direction, which causes the opening of backlash and the appearance of auto-oscillations. When lifting angle tends to the horizontal, the load torque increases, the backlash is closed under its action and torsion is not required. In addition, near the vertical, the wind load contributes to the disclosure of backlash. So, the control system allows to reduce the influence of backlash at lifting angles close to the vertical and to distribute the load between electric drives at lifting angles close to the horizontal, as well as when exposed to wind load.

Based on the traditional MMC, the horizontal sub-modules (SMs) are interconnected by high frequency links (HFL) of isolated four full-bridges (IFFB), which also forms a low-voltage DC bus. SM voltage fluctuation is an inherent problem of conventional MMC, which usually needs to be solved by large size capacitor. In this paper, the phase difference between SM fluctuating powers is used to achieve mutual cancellation, which significantly reduces the size of capacitor. Moreover, the cancellation process is completed automatically through interconnected channels, which simplifies the control of the system.

Tan,2022,2020 American Control Conference (ACC),IEEE Conferences,2,"Autonomous underwater gliders have become valuable, energy-efficient tools for a myriad of applications including ocean exploration, fish tracking, and environmental sampling. Many applications, such as, exploring a large area of underwater ruins or navigating through a coral reef, would benefit from fine trajectory tracking. However, trajectory tracking control of underwater gliders is particularly challenging due to their under-actuated, nonlinear dynamics. Taking gliding robotic fish as an example, in this work we propose a backstepping-based controller for the gliding motion to track a desired reference for the pitch angle and position in the 3D space. In particular, the challenge of under-actuation is addressed by exploiting the coupled dynamics and introducing a new modified error term that combines pitch and horizontal position tracking errors.

On the basis of this concept a new and original control design problem, using the 2D FTS as a constraint, is proposed. In fact, a prominent parametric insensitive control design for LTI systems is recast here as an FTS control design for a specific 2D system. Moreover, the paper not only gives an extension of the 1D FTS concept to 2D systems but also proposes some extended LMI conditions, with a reduced conservatism, for achieving robust closed-loop FTS by means of a state-feedback.

Many challenges could arise if the VTOL is navigating in hostile environments presenting disturbances in the form of load torque applied to the overall system. The system has to quickly perform tasks while ensuring stability and accuracy and must behave rapidly with regards to decision making facing disturbances. This technique offers some advantages over conventional control methods namely the classical PID controller.

710,Switching Logic-Based Nonlinear Feedback Control of Offshore Ship-Mounted Tower Cranes: A Disturbance Observer-Based Approach,Y. Qian; Y. Fang,2019,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,IEEE Journals,34,"We propose, in this paper, an observer-based nonlinear feedback controller for four degrees of freedom (4-DOF) offshore ship-mounted tower cranes, which includes a robust-type term to address the observation uncertainty, and a switching logic tuning mechanism to update the involved unknown parameter. As a typical nonlinear underactuated mechatronic system, unlike the land-fixed tower cranes, an offshore ship-mounted tower crane also suffers from persistent disturbances caused by sea waves or currents, which leads to many difficulties and challenges in the controller design of such systems. Existing offshore crane control methods require either linearizations or approximations when performing analysis; moreover, most of them are only applicable for simplified 2-DOF crane models, and the ranges of system state errors cannot be guaranteed during the overall process. Motivated by these facts, to achieve simultaneous accurate jib/trolley positioning and fast payload swings suppression against complex unknown external disturbances, in particular, a disturbance observer is first designed in this paper, based on which a novel nonlinear switching logic-based control scheme for offshore cranes with jib rotation and horizontal transportation is proposed. As far as we know, the proposed method yields the first observer-based feedback closed-loop control without simplification operations to the original 4-DOF offshore tower crane dynamics and achieves the first asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point for offshore cranes. To support the theoretical derivation, the corresponding stability analysis of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point is implemented by Lyapunov techniques. Numerous simulation and hardware experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the issue of controlling a four- degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) offshore ship-mounted tower crane system under the effects of unknown external disturbances. In practical applications, the persistent disturbances caused by sea waves or currents can always happen and make the offshore crane operation very challenging. Moreover, it brings more difficulties in the controller design for such a system due to its nonlinear underactuated property. Existing control approaches for offshore cranes are developed based upon linearized or oversimplified crane models or require exact model knowledge, and they may not work well in the presence of harsh sea conditions. Toward this end, this paper suggests a new control approach for 4-DOF offshore tower cranes suffering from sea wave effects to achieve a satisfactory performance. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point is derived, implying that the accurate jib/trolley positioning and fast payload swings suppression against complex unknown external disturbances are achieved simultaneously. Preliminary physical experiments implemented on a self-built offshore tower crane hardware test bed verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed observer-based control method. In the future research, we will apply the suggested control approach to industrial offshore crane systems to improve their working efficiency.",Lyapunov methods;observer-based feedback control;offshore ship-mounted crane,,"Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"

The frequency domain features of 62 channels are delivered to two Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to obtain spatial domain features of horizontal and vertical representations respectively, and then two kinds of domain features are fused by the residual network. The attention mechanism is applied to effectively extract emotional representational information from the fused features. To solve the cross-subject problem of emotion recognition, the domain adaptation method is utilized, and a center alignment loss function is applied to increase the distance of inter-class and reduce the distance of intra-class. According to the experimental results, the average accuracies of 75.89% (subject- dependent) and 69.59% (cross-subject) are obtained. Moreover, the validation was also performed on the public dataset SEED, achieving average accuracies of 93.99% (subject-dependent) and 84.22% (cross-subject), respectively.",EEG signals;emotion recognition;domain adaptation;deep learning,,"Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory and Applications in Complicated Systems, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory and Applications in Complicated Systems, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory and Applications in Complicated Systems, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory and Applications in Complicated Systems, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory and Applications in Complicated Systems, TUT Maritime College, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China; Technical College for the Deaf, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"

Tic-toc control enables rotorcraft to fly almost in the vertical plane rather than the horizontal plane. It is one of the most challenging manoeuvrers to achieve autonomously. The problem has to our knowledge not yet been studied for quadcopters. Studying it could expand their flight envelope and improve their performance in extreme, aerobatic flight tasks.

The MiddleAUV is small autonomous underwater vehicle designed to study the control algorithms. This article discusses the one case of PID controllers design and results of numerical simulations.

When the AUV approaches a waypoint, a special unit generates a new waypoint and the AUV continues moving. The main difficulty was configuring the controllers for the non-linear version of the AUV model.

The role of the guidance law is to adjust the missile 's attack time to its nominal value, and use the remaining time error to represent the difference between the current remaining time and the nominal remaining time. According to the relative motion relationship between the missile and the target, the control of the yaw channel indirectly controls the distance between the missile and the target at the current time through the lead angle. Therefore, the guidance law indirectly controls the residual time error through the lead angle. For this control system, the desired slow dynamics subsystem and the fast dynamics subsystem are designed by the method of time scale separation.

Zhu,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,9,"For the parallel parking problem in narrow space, this paper proposes a trajectory tracking control method with a novel trajectory planning layer for autonomous parallel parking based on a numerical optimization algorithm and model predictive control. In the trajectory planning layer, the vehicle kinematics model suitable for the low-velocity parking scene is established. Considering the vehicle physical constraints, boundary condition constraints, and obstacle avoidance constraints during the parking process, the parking trajectory planning task is described as an optimal control problem, further transformed into a nonlinear programming problem by Gauss pseudo-spectral method. Taking the shortest parking completion time as the optimization objective function, the parking trajectories of the large, medium and small parking spaces are obtained, respectively. A parking trajectory tracking controller based on the model predictive control algorithm is designed in the trajectory tracking control layer. The linear error model is used as the prediction model, and the quadratic programming is adopted as the rolling optimization algorithm in the tracking controller. The velocity and front-wheel swing angle are obtained as control signals for parking trajectory tracking. Through CarSim and Simulink's co-simulation, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed parallel parking trajectory planning and tracking control method are verified. The co-simulation results show that the maximum tracking errors of horizontal and longitudinal positions are less than 0.15m. The maximum tracking errors of heading angle are less than 2° under three different parking spaces. Real vehicle tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical control method.

Li,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),IEEE Conferences,2,"Muscle synergy is a fundamental mechanism of motor control. Despite a number of studies focusing on muscle synergy during power grip and pinch at high-level force, relatively less is known about the functional interactions between muscles within low-level force production during precision pinch. Traditional analytical tools such as nonnegative matrix factorization or principal component analysis have limitations in processing nonlinear dynamic electromyographic signals and have confined sensitivity particularly for the low-level force production. In this study, we developed a novel method — multiplex muscle networks, to investigate the dynamical coordination of muscle activities at low-level force production during precision pinch. The multiplex muscle network was constructed based on multiplex limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph (MLPHVG). Seven forearm and hand muscles, including brachioradialis (BR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI), were examined using surface electromyography (sEMG). Eight healthy subjects were instructed to perform a visuomotor force tracking task by producing higher (10% MVC) and lower (1% MVC) precision pinch. Interlayer mutual information I, average edge overlap ω weighted clustering coefficient CW, weighted characteristic path length LW were selected as network metrics. We assessed the undirected weighted network generated from multiplex muscle network after taking the I between paired muscle network layers as edge. There are significant differences between higher and lower force level with higher I, ω, CW and lower LW at higher force level. Advanced efficiency of information processing in the regional and global perspective indicated dynamical alterations when human faces the higher force tracking task. It suggested that ω may be an important characteristic to classify different force control states with the average classification accuracy of 82.21%.

Wu,2023,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,IEEE Journals,2,"Continuum manipulators have infinite degrees of freedom and high flexibility, making it challenging for accurate modeling and control. Some common modeling methods include mechanical modeling strategy, neural network strategy, constant curvature assumption, etc. However, the inverse kinematics of the mechanical modeling strategy is difficult to obtain while a strategy using neural networks may not converge in some applications. For algorithm implementation, the constant curvature assumption is used as the basis to design the controller. When the driving wire is tight, the linear controller under constant curvature assumption works well in manipulator position control. However, this assumption of linearity between the deformation angle and the driving input value breaks upon repeated use of the driving wires which get inevitably lengthened. This degrades the accuracy of the controller. In this work, the Koopman theory is used to identify the nonlinear model of the continuum manipulator. Under the linearized model, the control input is obtained through model predictive control (MPC). As the lifted function can affect the effectiveness of the Koopman operator-based MPC (K-MPC), a novel design method of the lifted function through the Legendre polynomial is proposed. To attain higher control efficiency and computational accuracy, we use a selective control scheme according to the state of the driving wires. When the driving wire is tight, the linear controller is employed; otherwise, the K-MPC is adopted.

For the nonlinear characteristics of the flow status of gas-liquid two-phase flow, a monitoring method based on principal polynomial analysis is proposed to extract the nonlinear characteristics of the flow status information. This method performs dimensionality reduction in multiple steps and uses polynomials for feature fitting, which can fully extract flow status information. Multiple sensors are used to obtain data representing different fluctuation characteristics in the flow process, models of different flow statuses are established, and status monitoring is realized based on statistical indicators.

Li,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,10,"Without the assistance of Global Positioning System (GPS), estimating the 3D position of indoor and outdoor pedestrians using a single wearable device is a daunting if not impossible task, especially if micro-sensors are used. Here, we present a novel 3D position estimation method using one integrated ankle sensing device, which consists of an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and a barometer. Pedestrians' vertical position is estimated by fusing the acceleration and angular velocity as well as the height derived from barometer data. To estimate pedestrians' horizontal position, we proposed an adaptive multimodal stride length model and a multi-sensor-fusion-based heading angle estimation method, using the Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) mechanism. By introducing a vertical variable into the stride length model, this new model greatly improved the applicability and accuracy of PDR in horizontal position estimation. Based on this new model, PDR can be used not only for estimating the horizontal position of the pedestrian walking on flat areas but also for those walking up and down stairs. The effectiveness and applicability of our method in 3D position estimation have been demonstrated in several different experiments of indoor and outdoor scenes. The first is when a pedestrian walks on an indoor flat ground, following a spiral trajectory. The estimation accuracy of pedestrians' height position is 1.5cm and the ratio of horizontal walking estimation error is 1.02m with a total walking distance of 53.1m. The second is when a pedestrian walks up staircases from Floor 4 to Floor 8 in a building. The cumulative error of the estimated height is 0.23m with a total height of 14.4m, and the root mean square error of the estimated horizontal 2D position is 15cm compared to a total horizontal walking distance of 38.4m. The third case involves a pedestrian walking on audience stands of an outdoor stadium and returns to the starting position for a total distance of 94.4m. The estimation error from the sensing device is 0.92m in this case, with mean error of the estimated height position of each step at 3.3cm.

The proposed tail-sitter adopts an innovative varying fuselage shape design to break the technical bottleneck in the balance of efficient horizontal flight and agile vertical flight. Overset grids and computational fluid dynamic methods are used to explore the vehicle’s prestall aerodynamics, which are relative to not only the angle of attack and sideslip angle but also to the varying angle between two rear fuselage’s parts. High angle of attack aerodynamics based on the improved Viterna and Corrigan stall model is also established for this novel tail-sitter. Meanwhile, an accurate model of the propeller is tested in a wind tunnel. Combining the forces and moments generated by propellers, aerodynamics and gravity, a 6DoF nonlinear time-varying dynamic model is built. A robust controller based on incremental dynamic inversion method is designed for this tail-sitter, which is good at dealing with uncertainties and external forces. Nominal and model mismatch conditions are simulated to verify the controller’s performance. Different varying strategies for the mechanism are analyzed during the transition flight.

Keshmiri,2020,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,1,"In this paper, the propwash phenomenon for pusher configuration unmanned aerial systems (UASs) is studied. The SkyHunter UAS has the propeller placed aft of the fuselage and in front of the horizontal tail with no offset from the zero lift plane. Thus, the propeller slipstream directly flows over the horizontal tail affecting its aerodynamics. To validate the physics based model developed for propwash impacts and to quantify the effects of propwash, the SkyHunter UAS was equipped with an extra pitot tube. The first pitot tube was placed at the nose of the aircraft where the air is undisturbed and it was measuring the aircraft's velocity. The second pitot tube was placed at different locations on the horizontal tail and three flight tests were conducted. Flight test data showed that the current configuration of the SkyHunter: (A) has large variations in the horizontal tail dynamic pressure ratio along the span of the horizontal tail. (B) had the dynamic pressure ratio higher than 1.7 in two of the three investigated locations along the span of the horizontal tail. This suggests that the theoretical estimate of the dynamic pressure ratio (which is 0.93) may be an under estimation. (C) The dynamic pressure ratio varied with time during flight. A change in the horizontal tail dynamic pressure ratio directly leads to a shift in the location of the aerodynamic center of an aircraft as well as changes in the stability and control derivatives of an aircraft. The implication of these changes in small UASs can be significant since they affect the aircraft longitudinal stability, trim elevator, and flight characteristics. In order to mitigate such changes during flight, a redesign was made to the original empennage design where is an offset was added between the zero lift plane and the aerodynamic center of the horizontal tail. This redesign intends to move the horizontal tail above (and away from) the propeller slipstream. Manufacturing of the redesigned horizontal tail was completed recently and it was flight tested. Flight test data from the new design show that the new design successfully mitigates the effects of the propwash.",,,"University of Kansas, 1450 Jayhawk Blvd., Lawrence, KS; University of Kansas, 1450 Jayhawk Blvd., Lawrence, KS; University of Kansas, 1450 Jayhawk Blvd., Lawrence, KS"

The use of intelligent systems during the oil storage and handling process enhances quality preservation and reduction of motor fuel waste caused by evaporation, oxidation and hydration while stored in above-ground horizontal steel tanks. Systems managing ""smart"" oil-storage facilities combine technologies for on-line collection, transmission and storage of information with instant data processing and analysis, and managerial decision-making techniques. A methodological framework, that includes algorithms and a program with sensors to monitor indicators of an automated horizontal oil reservoir, has been developed to control the technological parameters (temperature, pressure, fuel level) of the tanks during storage of light oil products, and to protect fuel against flooding and evaporation. The application of the neural network forecasting technique for fuel waste from evaporation during storage, and processing of the data array, made it possible to calculate with a 98% accuracy rate the gasoline waste during storage in horizontal on-ground tanks with up to 100 m3 in volume capacity. The application of a neural network enables development of new fuel storage algorithms and calculation of the optimal storage amount to minimise losses.

Qiao,2021,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,IEEE Journals,12,"Upper limb loss has significant effects on the individual’s quality of life. Artificial prosthetic limbs as an alternative to the lost limb are designed to allow amputees to regain motor function. Motion classification via extracted surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals is widely utilized to realize a friendly human–robot interface in the control of the prosthesis. However, limited classification of discrete motion patterns from sEMG prevents intuitive motor control. Thus, instead of using discrete patterns, decoding the human intention continuously from sEMG would significantly benefit the prosthesis control. In this article, we propose a muscle-synergy-based intention decoding and motion planning that can model a broad set of complex upper limb movements as a combination of motor primitives. A novel muscle activation-to-force mapping model is developed to detect muscular effort of the healthy side to drive the affected side. A neural-network-approximation-based controller is developed for the bionic neuroprosthetic arm to execute the movement. Operational experiments with prosthetic movement control were performed on four healthy participants and an upper limb amputee participant. Results of controlling prosthetic arm ($0.94\pm 0.02$ of $\Re ^{2}$ in the horizontal reaching tasks and $0.95\pm 0.01$ in the vertical reaching tasks for the healthy subjects, 0.95 and 0.97 for the amputee) demonstrate that our control method could successfully capture human movement intention and effectively control the movement of prosthesis.",Neural network approximator;nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF);prosthesis control;simultaneous force estimation;surface electromyogram (sEMG),,"Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex System, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China"

However, the problem of planning an energy-efficient path for the surveillance purpose while anticipating disturbances and predicting energy consumptions during the path tracking is still a challenging problem in recent years. The optimal path planning and the disturbance rejection control for a UAV surveillance system are investigated in this paper. A trained and tested energy consumption regression model is used to be the cost function of an optimal path planning scheme, which is designed from a clustered 3D real pilot flight pattern with the proposed K-agglomerative clustering method, and is processed via A-star and set-based particle-swarm-optimization (S-PSO) algorithm with adaptive weights. Moreover, an online adaptive neural network (ANN) controller with varied learning rates is designed to ensure the control stability while having a reliably fast disturbance rejection response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results. By applying the proposed optimal path planning scheme, the energy consumption of the optimal path is only 72.3397 Wh while the average consumed energy of real pilot flight data is 96.593Wh. In addition, the proposed ANN control improves average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of horizontal and vertical tracking performance by 49.083% and 37.50% in comparison with a proportional-integral-differential (PID) control and a fuzzy control under the occurrence of external disturbances.

In the second stage, two model predictive controllers are designed to control the vehicle motion in the horizontal and vertical planes by tracking the optimal setpoints. The proposed controller is compared with a conventional LOS-based control that maintains zero heave velocity relative to the current (i.e., relative heave velocity) and derives pitch angle setpoint using LOS guidance to reach the desired depth.

First, a distributed observer is designed for each follower to estimate the information of the leader and extended state observers are designed to estimate the unmeasured velocities as well as to recover lumped uncertainties induced by parameter perturbations and external disturbances. Based on the observation results, the formation tracking laws are proposed in kinematic and dynamic level, while desired tracking performance and robustness are guaranteed.

The vertical motion trajectory ensures a continuous center of mass position, speed, and acceleration, as well as minimizes the maximum torque and maximum speed of the joints; we generated it via a nonlinear optimal process. Besides, for the horizontal motion, we proposed a novel model predictive control using a height varying inverted pendulum model.

In this paper, we propose a control scheme that uses the center of gravity (CoG) variation caused by the tilt of the pilot standing on a quadrotor to maneuver it in the horizontal plane. Keeping potential applications in mind, we design controllers for two modes of operation: a) Maneuver via leaning mode during which the quadrotor converts the forward CoG shift into a proportional forward speed, and the sideward CoG shift to a yaw rate, thus enabling a turn, and b) Remote control mode in which the quadrotor platform rejects all the disturbances including the pilot's movements and maintains the desired speed and turn commands provided by the pilot using a hand-held remote control. We use a simplified model of a human standing on a quadrotor to test the proposed control laws using simulations.

Therefore, PEC9 is an active capacitor voltage-balancing converter where the capacitors voltages are adjusted to the right amplitude using only redundant switching states. Thanks to this prominent advantage, PEC9 is an appropriate nine-level topology for grid-tied inverter as the capacitors voltages are not required to be involved in grid-tied control technique.

832,Voltage-Controlled Polarization at 0.1 THz Based on Phase-Tuned Coupled Oscillation via a Magic Tee,K. Sasao; Y. Monnai,2022,IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology,IEEE Journals,1,"We propose a technique to implement voltage-controlled polarization at 0.1 THz using a pair of phase-tuned Gunn diode oscillators coupled through a WR10 magic tee hybrid coupler. By finely tuning the free-running oscillation frequency with bias voltage, we can control the phase difference between the two coupled oscillators. Since the two output ports of the hybrid coupler correspond to the sum and difference of the signals from the two coupled oscillators, the power ratio between the two output ports can be adjusted arbitrarily by tuning their phase difference. Thus, by connecting a pair of orthogonal horn antennas to the output ports, an arbitrary polarization ratio can be obtained. The maximum polarization ratio observed in this study is 31.8 dB. To fully switch the polarization between the vertical and horizontal directions, a frequency shift of 26.6 MHz (0.03%) at around 94.3 GHz is involved when changing the bias voltage of one of the two oscillators. This frequency shift could be compensated by carefully controlling the bias voltages of the two oscillators simultaneously.

However, to maintain proper safe flight distances, cables always stay inclined, which implies that horizontal force components have to be generated by UAVs, and only partial thrust forces are used for gravity compensation. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, a new cooperative transportation system named Truss Aerial Transportation System (TATS) is proposed, where those horizontal forces can be internally compensated by the bar spherical joint structure. In the TATS, rigid bars can powerfully sustain the desired distances among UAVs for safe flight, resulting in a more compact and effective transportation system. Thanks to the structural advantage of the truss, the rigid bars can be made lightweight so as to minimize their induced gravity burden. The construction method of the proposed TATS is presented.

Especially when the motion includes flight phases, state-of-the-art approaches fail to produce reliable estimation of the robot posture, in particular base height. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for combining visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with leg odometry in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimator. The VIO module uses a stereo camera and IMU to yield low-drift 3D position and yaw orientation and drift-free pitch and roll orientation of the robot base link in the inertial frame. However, these values have a considerable amount of latency due to image processing and optimization, while the rate of update is quite low which is not suitable for low-level control. To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state estimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module uses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further with a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot state estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control.

Comparing with the power of prototype, it can be seen that installing the L tip vane can improve the output of wind turbine. When the wind speed is in the range of 9 m s−1to 19 m s−1, the effect is obvious. Comparing the surface pressure of the extended-blade, it can be found that installed L tip vane can increase the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the blade tip, especially the suction surface and the leading edge of the blade tip. With the increase of wind speed, L tip vane impact on the vortex core strength of the wind turbine increases first and then decreases. When the wind speed is in the range of 11.4m s−1to 19m s-1, the L tip vane has a greater influence on the tip vortex strength of the wind turbine. Compared with the extended tip blade, adding L tip vane at the tip of the blade can effectively control the thrust of the wind turbine and the flapping moment at the root of the blade while improving the output of the wind turbine, and reduce the wind turbine load.",L tip vane;performance;pressure field;blade-tip vortex;thrust,,"School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China; School of Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China"

Gutman,2019,2019 27th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED),IEEE Conferences,0,"An innovative approach of controlling a system with multiple Degrees-of-Freedom performing complex maneuvers is presented. A system under investigation is a human body maneuvering during a free-fall stage of skydiving, which is a rapidly developing sport. The objective is creating an autonomous system capable of performing skydiving maneuvers in a virtual way, and turning it into a powerful tool for improving instruction methods. The key idea is to build a skydiving skill from a set of basic and advanced maneuvers, replicating human natural skill acquisition stages. For each type of maneuver a control algorithm is designed based on the specific plant dynamics, task constraints, and analysis of body actuation possibilities. The main challenge is combining these control schemes to enable the virtual skydiver perform realistic tasks. In the present work we develop a model predictive controller for the fall-rate adjustment, which is the essential skill for performing cooperative maneuvers. We exploit the differential flatness property of the plant in the vertical dimension in order to combine the fall-rate controller with a previously developed Two-Input-Two-Output controller for horizontal maneuvers.

Zhong,2019,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,46,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have received a lot of attention as it can significantly improve efficiency and safety of road traffic. In general, V2V scenarios have some special features such as high mobility of transceivers, low antenna height, and small communication ranges, which significantly affect the propagation characteristics. Therefore, an accurate channel model is required to characterize V2V propagation channel. However, some important features of V2V channels have not been well characterized, for example, most existing V2V channel models tend to only consider the distribution of multipath components (MPCs) in a horizontal dimension, whereas ignoring vertical dimension, which is inconsistent with the distribution of MPCs in the actual channel. Moreover, the dynamic clusters of MPCs have not been well modeled in the existing V2V models. Therefore, in order to better model the V2V channel, a cluster-based three-dimensional (3D) channel model is proposed in this paper, which is based on the measurements conducted at 5.9 GHz in urban and suburban scenarios. In the proposed model, the distribution of MPCs clusters in both horizontal and vertical dimensions is considered. The space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm is used to extract MPCs, and the clustering and tracking algorithms are used to identify and track the clusters of dynamic MPCs. In the proposed model, all MPC clusters are divided into two categories: global-clusters and scatterer-clusters, and the distribution of the two clusters are characterized by a series of inter- and intra-cluster parameters. It is found that both the azimuth spread and the elevation spread follow the lognormal distribution. In addition, the power of MPCs within a cluster has the truncated-Gaussian distribution, whereas the angle of MPCs within a cluster has the Laplacian distribution. Finally, the accuracy of the model is verified by comparing the measurements and simulations.",Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V);channel measurement;cluster-based channel model,,"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; Huawei Technologies, Xi’an, China; Huawei Technologies, Xi’an, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"

Graph features are extracted from this representation to serve as input to an XGBoost classifier.

Positioner is designed to deliver requisite torque against a defined wind force but more importantly, under varied temperature conditions. At extremely low temperatures, the performance of positioner is affected due to change in motor characteristics [1] and thus affects the overall operation of system. This paper explains the improvisation in hardware as well as usage of advanced control algorithm utilizing the concept of ‘speed de-rating’ to counter the shortcomings and as a result development of a positioner (BE12M) with accuracy of 0.1° and 770Nm resisting torque. Antenna Positioner with VSAT Controller (BE12M) provides motion to the reflector in horizontal (Azimuth) and vertical (Elevation) axis. Motion in Azimuth and Elevation is provided by gears and motors aesthetically assembled on to the positioner. Post link establishment with the satellite, Antenna position possess negligible variation in respective axes beyond a threshold and is very accurate. This accuracy is governed by beam pointing accuracy of Antenna system, which typically is 1/5th of the beam width. Lower the beam width, higher the accuracy of positioner is required.

Experimental data collected on a single subject provided the reference for qualitative movement comparison. The movement predicted by the OC exhibits the major characteristics of the real movement (e.g. preparation phase, joint torque and articular angle patterns).

Rouchon,2019,2019 IEEE 58th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),IEEE Conferences,0,"This work considers the control of an ensemble of non-interacting half-spin systems (Bloch equations) in a vertical static field B0 subject to a pair of controlled radiofrequency inputs (u1(t), u2(t)) acting on the horizontal plane. The state M(t, ω) ∈ S2 belongs to the Bloch sphere S2, and it is indexed by the Larmor frequency ω ∈ (ω*, ω*). Previous works have constructed a local stabilizing feedback based on a Lyapunov functional which is essentially a convenient H1-norm of a Sobolev space H1((ω*, ω*), S2) (see Beauchard, Pereira da Silva and Rouchon [3]-[4]). This feedback assures local L°°convergence of the initial state M0(ω) to -e3. However, the control law of that paper is a sum of a (infinite dimensional) state feedback with a T-periodic comb of π-Rabi pulses (Dirac impulses). The present work shows that one may replace this comb of Dirac pulses by adiabatic pulses. It is shown in the paper that, if ||M0(ω) + e3||H1 is small enough, our control strategy assures, for any ε > 0, the existence of a pair (T, ℓ) where T ∈ ℝ and ℓ ∈ N such that ||(ℓT,·) + e3||L∞ ≤ ε. Simulations has shown that this new strategy produces faster convergence than the one that is based on the comb of Rabi pulses.

In order to improve the quality of forecasting dynamic data flows, it is proposed to apply preliminary digital processing (filtering) of signals to decompose the observed time series coming from the sensors of the IACS into separate components, that is, to conduct a preliminary structural analysis of the observed time series. With this approach, component decomposition of the initial signal and serial noise filtering using a parallel set of digital filters are performed, which (as shown in the investigation) significantly improves the quality of the generated forecast. The study also conducted an analysis of the error of the forecast result, that is, the signal of the difference between the original signal and its forecast, using digital spectral and bispectral analysis. It is assumed that for the case of “perfect prediction” the prediction error is an unpredictable residue, that is, tends to a state of white noise. The paper shows that the analysis of forecast errors using digital spectral and bispectral analysis methods allows you to form an assessment of the quality of the forecast result. In the study, a comparison of the results for the case of generating a forecast using and without using preliminary digital filtering was carried out on the same initial test signal.

In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions for controlling the horizontal and vertical elasticity of container-based applications with the goal to increase the flexibility to cope with varying workloads. Although RL represents an interesting approach, it may suffer from a possible long learning phase, especially when nothing about the system is known a-priori. To speed up the learning process and identify better adaptation policies, we propose RL solutions that exploit different degrees of knowledge about the system dynamics (i.e., Q-learning, Dyna-Q, and Model-based).

Conventional PPM EMATs generate ultrasonic waves, which simultaneously propagate both forward and backward. This can be an undesirable characteristic, since the backward wave can be eventually reflected, reaching the receiver transducer where it can mix with the signal of interest. This limitation can be overcome using two side-shifted PPM arrays and racetracks coils to generate SH waves in a single direction. That design relies on the EMAT wavefront diffraction to produce constructive and destructive interference, but produces unwanted backward traveling sidelobes. Here, we present a different design, which uses a conventional PPM array and a dual linear-coil array. The concept was numerically simulated, the main design parameters were assessed and the unidirectional EMAT was experimentally evaluated on an aluminum plate, generating the SH0-guided wave mode nominally in a single direction. The amplitude ratio of the generated waves at the enhanced to the weakened side is above 20 dB.

A considerable number of tasks in the system will not rely on the central plane and will be directly routed to the target devices through the point-to-point routing method, which improves the horizontal scalability of the cloud control system. The point-to-point routing method directly gives a unique address to every task, making inter-task communication more efficient in a complex heterogeneous and busy cloud control systems. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the distributed point-to-point task routing approach is compatible against the state-of-the-art central systems in large-scale task situations.",cloud control system;task routing;cloud-edge-device cooperation,,"School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"

Zhang,2021,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,IEEE Journals,6,"In this article, a model-free controller is proposed to suppress residual vibration caused by the linkage flexibility after the positioning process. The controller is designed to release the potential energy rapidly by repeating a sequence comprising two steps. In the first step, the controller acts as a damper to absorb the deformation energy, whereas in the second step, neural network control is introduced for the purpose of returning to the target position smoothly. The controller is simple, and the only required feedback signal is from the motor encoder. The position error is proved to converge to zero within a small neighborhood through Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness of the controller is tested in three applications, an experiment study on a single-link flexible manipulator in horizontal plane and two simulation studies on a two-link flexible manipulator in horizontal plane and vertical plane, respectively. The settling time is decreased and energy efficiency is improved in all the three applications comparing with other controllers.",Control;flexible manipulator;neural network;trajectory tracking,,"School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Lassonde School of Engineering, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada"

For practical fail-safe flight, the quadcopter may fly with only three or two opposing propellers. Altitude for two-propeller architecture was maintained by a PID controller that is independent from the inner and outer controllers. A PID controller on propeller force deviations from equilibrium was augmented to the inner controller of the three-propeller architecture. Both architectures used LQR for the inner attitude controller and a damped second order outer controller that zeroes the error along the horizontal coordinates. The restrictiveness, stability, robustness, and symmetry of these architectures were investigated with respect to their output limits, initial conditions, and controller frequencies. Although the three-propeller architecture allows for distribution of propeller forces, the two-propeller architecture is more efficient, robust, and stable. The two-propeller architecture is also robust to model uncertainties.

Xiangqian,2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Energy Internet (ICEI),IEEE Conferences,0,"Due to the small scale and the randomness of the power of intermittent distributed generations (DG) and loads, islanded microgrids (IMGs) are vulnerable to voltage instability problems. IMGs with droop-controlled DGs are even more weak because no master DGs are responsible for the regulation of frequency and voltage. Continuous power flow (CPF) is an effective tool for static voltage stability analysis. However, a droop-regulated has its own unique features. The steady-state model of IMGs with droop-controlled DGs are different from those of traditional power systems. Moreover, the convergence of Newton-Raphson method for the load flow equations of IMGs with droop-controlled DGs is not satisfactory. Thus, a CPF calculation method based on Newton-Raphson with optimal multipliers for droop-regulated IMGs is proposed in this paper. The Newton-Raphson method with optimal multipliers is adopted to solve the initial point and the steady state solution of the correction step. The tangent prediction method and the local parameterization method is employed in the prediction step and the correction step respectively. Vertical correction is adopted in the initial steps, and then horizontal correction is adopted when approaching the critical point. Newton-Raphson method with optimal multipliers allow to track the PV curves with a larger step in the whole process.

The main cause was identified as the low response rate of the load division controller (LDC) that is switched on after the ski formation is complete. As a result, the motor moments differ by 2 times or more, which causes the increased temperature in the motor that has a greater load and an increased risk of accidents. The authors present the analysis of oscillograms showing that during the first passes of the roughing stage, the electric drive with the greater load reaches the moment limit and thus enters the uncontrolled mode. To overcome the said drawbacks, an electric drive control method was developed that includes forced alignment of roll motor speeds by eliminating the integral component and the amplification of the proportional component of the LDC output signal. The authors developed an adaptive LDC to implement this method. The research involved simulation modeling and experimentation of a rolling mill.

Compared with conventional emotion recognition methods by facial expression, text, gesture and speech, Electroencephalogram (EEG) can reflect the real emotional state, which shows an advantage in reliability and accuracy. In this paper, a novel horizontal and vertical flow model (HVFM) was proposed to learn the flow information between the horizontal and vertical transition of EEG channels. Firstly, we constructed a two-direction flow of EEG signals by the international EEG location. Then, we employed recurrent neural networks (RNN) with two flow directions to extract the deep emotion flow characteristic from the EEG electrodes. A domain discriminator that induces the model to obtain the source and target’s invariant emotion features. What is more, to minimize the variability between the two domains, we use a similar loss function.

Considering the diving of the autonomous underwater vehicle diving with a low speed near surface, the vehicle will experience roll because of the disturbance from waves. Intense roll motion will not only seriously affect the normal operation of underwater vehicles, but also increase navigational resistance. According to the conventional work mode of the fin stabilizer, it is difficult for the underwater vehicle to generate sufficient lift to resist the wave influence at a low speed.

Despite the progress in locomotion strategy, safely recovering from unexpected falls or planned drops is still an open problem. It is further made more difficult when high horizontal velocities are involved. In this letter, we propose an optimization-based reactive Landing Controller that uses only proprioceptive measures for torque-controlled quadruped robots that free-fall on a flat horizontal ground, knowing neither the distance to the landing surface nor the flight time. Based on an estimate of the Center of Mass horizontal velocity, the method uses the Variable Height Springy Inverted Pendulum model for continuously recomputing the feet position while the robot is falling. In this way, the quadruped is ready to attain a successful landing in all directions, even in the presence of significant horizontal velocities. The method is demonstrated to dramatically enlarge the region of horizontal velocities that can be dealt with by a naive approach that keeps the feet still during the airborne stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a quadruped robot can successfully recover from falls with horizontal velocities up to $3 \ \mathrm{m/s}$ in simulation.

Cegla,2021,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",IEEE Journals,17,"Inspection is a key part of the asset management process of industrial plants and there are numerous plate-like structures that require inspection. Ultrasonic guided waves have been extensively used to detect various types of defect by monitoring reflected and transmitted signals because they enable faster screening of large areas. However, ultrasonic guided wave testing becomes difficult for very shallow, sharp defects as current inspection techniques suffer from a lack of sensitivity to such features. Previous studies, obtained by comparing various inspection techniques, suggest that the SH1 mode in particular, at around 3 MHz  $\cdot$  mm, would be suitable when testing for shallow defects; however, it is clear that both the SH0 and SH1 modes can exist at this frequency–thickness product. This can complicate the inspection process and, therefore, limit defect detectability. This article investigates the possibility of a single-mode excitation of the SH1 mode at around 3 MHz  $\cdot$  mm. The ability of this method toward detecting very shallow defects (<10% cross-sectional thickness loss) has also been studied. By means of analytical predictions and finite element, it is shown that a signal dominated by the SH1 mode can be generated using a single permanent periodic magnet (PPM) electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) (PPM EMAT). All predictions are then backed up by experimental measurements. It is also shown that, by studying the reflection coefficient of the SH1 mode, the pure SH1 mode can be used to detect defects as shallow as 5% thickness loss from a 500-mm stand-off. These defects would otherwise be missed by standard, lower frequency guided wave testing.",2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT);defect sensitivity;mode-selectivity;permanent periodic magnet (PPM) electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT);shear-horizontal (SH) guided wave,,"Mechanical Engineering Department, Non-Destructive Evaluation Group, Imperial College London, London, U.K.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Non-Destructive Evaluation Group, Imperial College London, London, U.K."

Salamah,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,2,"Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) is used to generate the surface image of any conducting sample surface with an atomic-scale resolution. A multi-axis 3D piezoelectric actuator is attached with the STM tip to move it in horizontal (x and y) and vertical (z) directions. The purpose of control design is to achieve precise reference tracking for horizontal 2D scanning system and to keep the tunneling current constant in the vertical direction in the presence of all possible disturbances. A usual practice is to design independent single-input-single-output (SISO) controllers for individual x, y and z axes by neglecting the cross-coupling dynamics of the multi-axis 3D piezoelectric actuator. In this paper, a complete 3D STM system, without neglecting the cross-coupling dynamics as well as the hysteresis nonlinearity of the actuator, is first mathematically modeled. The parameters of the hysteresis model are identified from the real-time experimental data by using the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting problem. A feedforward compensator is then designed without finding an inverse hysteresis model to avoid any inverse modeling complexity. Then, two control strategies (SISO and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)  $\text{H}_\infty $  feedback controllers cascaded in series with the feedforward compensator) are investigated for an overall 3D system. Three different scanning trajectories (raster, spiral and Lissajous) are considered to analyze and compare the performance of SISO and MIMO control schemes.

Treatment of fluids coming from a hydrocarbon well is quite complex. The first process applied to these fluids is to separate their phases (liquid and gas) so further processes can take place. In the case of the oil industry, the fluid can be further separated in heavy liquid (water and other heavy elements) and light liquid (hydrocarbons and other elements). The equipment responsible for this work is the three-phase separator. The following work presents a wide approach to a three-phase separator that covers the progression from a parallelepiped to a horizontal cylinder shape, including the use of a weir plate. A gravity three-phase mixture is simulated as two immiscible liquid and gas. The model focused on the liquid behaviour inside the tank, the movement of the gas is assumed to be at constant pressure, equal to atmospheric pressure. During this work, a comprehensive model was built using MatLab Simulink®. A horizontal parallelepiped model is used to introduce the concepts of height limits and control strategies and a horizontal cylindrical model is used to show an actual geometry. Design calculations are done using steady-state conditions and control strategies are normally introduced afterwards.

However, the general analytical form of streamlines in 3D is unknown. In this paper, we show how streamline control can be used in 3D environments by assuming a 2.5D model of ocean currents. We provide an efficient algorithm that acts as a steering function for a single rise or dive component of the glider's sawtooth trajectory, integrate this algorithm within a sampling-based motion planning framework to support long-distance path planning, and provide several examples in simulation in comparison with a baseline method. The key to our method's computational efficiency is an elegant dimensionality reduction to a 1D control region.

Adding phononic crystal is not only capable of reducing the body vibration and steady-state tracking error, but also owns better robustness. The horizontal dynamic analysis of the formation of UAVs is carried out in the presence of external unknown factors. Then, an “integrated” controller is designed to control leader’s speed so that “follower” can track the “leader” in the case of decoupling, while maintaining the consensus of relative speed. The simulation results show that the “integrated” control method integrates the advantages of robust control and phononic crystal vibration attenuation.",,,"School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China; School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China; School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China"

Takhirov,2021,"2021 3rd International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications (HORA)",IEEE Conferences,1,"Quality control during construction is important for many reasons. For one, it can be used for the evaluation and assessment of the as-built condition. The latter state of the construction can be used for making small adjustments of other elements comprising the future structural system. For example, it can be used for assessing the pile's final location, twist, and inclination after driving the pile into the ground. A possibility of small deviations is quite common in this case. In addition, the imperfections captured during the construction can be used in forensic studies or other reconnaissance efforts of the structural failures, if any. A terrestrial laser scanner can capture an object's exposed surface with high accuracy. By measuring the duration of travel of a laser beam emitted by the scanner, it can estimate locations of the object's points in space. A set of these points is commonly called a point cloud. The paper's main objective is to evaluate an approach for measuring imperfections in installation of steel structural members. The approach is based on utilization of a terrestrial laser scanner. As a typical example of structural members, a wide flange steel beam is studied herein. The approach is based on the analysis of numerous horizontal slices of the beam's point cloud. A tight bounding box is computed for each slice and its location is compared against other horizontal slices. Based on this analysis, the beam's basic dimensions, twist and inclination are obtained. The paper provides an approach for a quantitative assessment of the beam's deviations from its as-drawn configuration.",Terrestrial Laser Scanner;Quality Control;Structural Health Monitoring;Wide Flange Beam;Steel Frame Building,,"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Structures Lab, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA"

The robot reads the feedback system sensor to maintain balance by detecting the angle of inclination to react correctly to maintain a stable vertical position. Feedback data is inserted into the subtraction unit with reference to control system which produces output in the form of torque to the motor to rotate the reaction wheel. The purpose of this project is to create modelling of plant that implied Gyro Disc Actuator System (GDAS) and use Simulink simulation to analysis stability control and prove controller system response that can balance itself.

Tavakoli,2019,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,IEEE Journals,4,"In this paper, we design a set of two-dimensional (2-D) needle steering controllers used to minimize the 3-D deflection of a flexible, bevel-tipped needle. The controllers are based on a nonlinear design tool known as integrator-backstepping. The needle's deflection is split into its two 2-D planar problems, each of which is then governed by its own, separate controller. One controller, called vertical deflection control (VDC), steers the needle so that it deflects primarily along the vertical plane. The second controller, called horizontal deflection control (HDC), steers the needle so that it deflects primarily along the horizontal plane. Our 3-D steering algorithm combines the effect of these two controllers based on the current magnitude of the deflection along each plane. Using an 18 gauge brachytherapy needle, we tested our proposed method on a phantom tissue composed of liquid plastic, and a two-layer biological tissue formed of gelatin and ex vivo beef. Without needle steering, the average needle deflection was 11.2 mm.

Zhong,2020,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,70,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications have recently drawn great attention. To analyze and optimize the UAV communication systems, accurate and efficient UAV channel models are essential. Most existing UAV channel models are based on the assumption that both transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) have fixed velocity and moving direction. However, in the realistic communication scenarios, the Tx and Rx of UAV may experience changes in both speeds and trajectories. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed for air-to-air (A2A) channels in UAV communication scenarios. A 3D Markov mobility model is used to characterize the movements of the UAV in both horizontal and vertical directions. The mobility model enables to adjust the degree of mobility randomness and covers different UAV mobility trajectories, which makes it more realistic and suitable for simulating various scenarios. In addition, some important statistical properties such as time-frequency correlation function and Doppler power spectrum are derived and analyzed. The numerical results show that the impact of vertical movement of the UAV on the time correlation function under constant-speed is larger than that of horizontal movement, however, the above phenomenon is mitigated and the non-stationarity properties of the channel are significantly affected when randomness of the mobility model is introduced. Furthermore, it is found that the movement properties of the UAV only lead to non-stationarity in the time domain. The results are useful for A2A non-stationary channel simulation and UAV communication system evaluation.",Three dimensional (3D) channel model;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);air-to-air (A2A) communication;Gauss-Markov mobility model;non-stationary,,"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"

An energy-optimal control problem is formulated using the model, and solutions are calculated and discussed for a range of hover-to-hover flight operations, which include both vertical and horizontal components. To allow for rapid, flexible, and computationally efficient generation of target state trajectories for real-time control applications, polynomial equations are used to approximate the optimized trajectories, which are segmented and normalized based on features of the optimized behaviors. The energy performance of the polynomial trajectories is compared to that of the original optimal trajectories in simulation with feedback control, demonstrating very close energy consumption. Additionally, a baseline PID controller is defined for comparison, and is shown to result in an increased energy use of 11.2% over feedback control using the optimized trajectories.

In this condition, the UUV motion model in the horizontal plane has a high relative degree, thus increasing the design complexity. In contrast to observer-based FTC schemes, we introduce a dynamic compensator, which produces an augmented error system whose dynamics is minimum phase and relative degree one. An adaptive learning observer is then introduced to address the composite uncertainties arising from actuator faults, uncertain nonlinearities, actuator saturation and disturbances.

929,Wildfire Fighting by Unmanned Aerial System Exploiting Its Time-Varying Mass,D. A. Saikin; T. Baca; M. Gurtner; M. Saska,2020,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,IEEE Journals,27,"This letter presents an approach for accurately dropping a relatively large amount of fire retardant, water or some other extinguishing agent onto a wildfire from an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close proximity to the epicenter of the fire. The proposed approach involves a risky maneuver outside of the safe flight envelope of the UAV. This maneuver exploits the expected weight reduction resulting from the release of the payload, enabling the UAV to recover without impacting the terrain. The UAV is tilted to high pitch angles, at which the thrust may be pointed almost horizontally. The vehicle can therefore achieve higher horizontal speeds than would be allowed by conventional motion planners. This high speed allows the UAV to significantly reduce the time spent close to the fire. As a result, the overall high heat exposure is reduced, and the payload can be dropped closer to the target, minimizing its dispersion. A constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is solved taking into account environmental parameters such as wind and terrain gradients, as well as various payload releasing mechanisms. The proposed approach was verified in simulations and in real experiments. Emphasis was put on the real time recalculation of the solution, which will enable future adaptation into a model predictive controller (MPC) scheme.",Aerial systems: applications;motion and path planning;optimization and optimal control,,"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague 6, Czech Republic"

The compact mechanism enables the robot to run and jump only with four motors. However, the robot’s underactuation and instability make it difficult to achieve simultaneous run-and-jump motion. In order to solve this problem, a motion planning and control scheme is proposed. First, the dynamic model of the compact two-wheeled legged robot is established. Subsequently, the run-and-jump trajectory is planned by using nonlinear programming. In order to accurately execute the planned trajectories, two controllers are respectively designed for the jumping motion and running motion. Specifically, an impedance tracking controller is designed to achieve smooth and compliant jumping behavior under different practical conditions. On the other hand, an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller is constructed to realize the stable running motion. The overall planning and control scheme is validated in Simscape.

Nine healthy right-handed subjects used five fingers to grasp a special device in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Two independent variables were set in the experiment: the COM of the grasping device and the visual delay time. Place a 50 g mass randomly at five different directions of the grasping device base. The three levels of visual delay time appear randomly. The kinematics and dynamics and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during the experiment. The brain network was constructed based on multiplex horizontal visibility graph (MHVG). Interlayer mutual information (MI) and phase locking value (PLV) were calculated to quantify the network, while clustering coefficient (C), shortest path length (L) and overall network efficiency (E) are selected to quantify the network characteristic. Statistical results show that when the mass is located in the radial side, during the load phase of grasping, the C and E is significantly higher than that in the proximal, ulnar and medial side, and L was significantly lower than that in the proximal and radial side. This shows that when grasping an object with a COM bias on the radial side, the process of brain feedforward control has higher level of information interaction and ability and it can build stronger sensorimotor memory. It is also found that the brain network features of theta, beta and gamma bands of EEG are positively correlated, especially between beta and gamma bands, which suggests there is a coupling relationship between different bands in information processing and transmission.Clinical Relevance— This study explains the neural mechanism of grasping control from the topological structure of the whole brain network level and the informatics.",,,"Laboratory of Rehabilitation Engineering, Intelligent Medical Engineering Research Center, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Laboratory of Rehabilitation Engineering, Intelligent Medical Engineering Research Center, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Laboratory of Rehabilitation Engineering, Intelligent Medical Engineering Research Center, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Laboratory of Rehabilitation Engineering, Intelligent Medical Engineering Research Center, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Laboratory of Rehabilitation Engineering, Intelligent Medical Engineering Research Center, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"
935,Prediction of Energy Consumption in Horizontal Roughing Process of Hot Rolling Strip Based on TDADE Algorithm,Y. Zhong; J. Wang; J. Xu; S. Wu; J. Rao; K. Dang,2023,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"The steel industry is the key industry of energy consumption. The optimization of rolling process parameters is an effective measure to reduce and optimize energy consumption. Accurate energy consumption prediction has an indispensable guiding function in the planning of process parameters. However, the traditional energy consumption prediction and machine learning methods have been unable to fit the needs of high precision and reliability. Taking the horizontal roughing process (HRP) of hot rolling process as the research object, this paper mainly introduces an energy consumption prediction mechanism model (ECPMM) based on a roller adaptive wear strategy by analyzing the strip forming mechanism and rolling process. Then, two directions adaptive differential evolution (TDADE) algorithm is proposed based on a novel adaptive strategy. This algorithm has better convergence speed and global optimization ability than other optimization algorithms in the parameter optimization of ECPMM. We carried out comparative experiments on five machine learning algorithms. The results show that the ECPMM optimized by TDADE is superior to the five machine learning algorithms in prediction accuracy and stability. Finally, we conducted ablation experiments on the energy consumption characteristics of the HRP process, which turns out that using a smaller reduction and roller radius can reduce energy consumption. Summarizing the above experimental results suggests that the ECPMM has high accuracy and robustness, and satisfies the requirements of practical application. Note to Practitioners—It is necessary to carry out the deep analysis and research of energy consumption prediction involved in the process planning of strip hot rolling, the inspiration of this article is stem from this point. The commonly used energy consumption prediction methods include mechanism modeling and machine learning, but both have disadvantages, like low prediction accuracy and black box, which must have to be performed to solve by adapting the production demand of high reliability. In this paper, the combination of the mechanism model and data-driven method is used to realize the accurate prediction of energy consumption and improve the reliability of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper about the research on energy consumption prediction of hot rolling process based on mechanism model and data-driven, especially in data size, time granularity, algorithm design, and prediction performance. Such research is helpful to guide engineers to design rolling energy consumption.

Attitude outputs of the SINS, distance increment outputs of the odometer, and velocity outputs of Doppler radar are taken to accomplish position and velocity calculation. The error models of the odometer and Doppler radar are studied, and error models of position and velocity calculation are established. Errors including that of the SINS, odometer, and Doppler radar are taken as the system state of integrated navigation. The difference between the SINS position output and the previous position calculation output, as well as between the SINS velocity output and the previous velocity calculation output, is taken as the measurement information. On this basis, the Kalman filter algorithm is used in the design of a high-precision integrated navigation filter. The vehicle trajectory is designed and generated, and the researched navigation method is simulated and verified by MATLAB. Simulation results show that in the navigation time of 10800 s, the horizontal position accuracy is ±27.8 m, the altitude accuracy is ±11.2 m, and the error of position does not exceed 0.03% of the vehicle’s total driving distance.

Finally, the vehicular experiment is carried out, and the experimental results show that the actual application effect of the SINS/odometer/Doppler radar integrated navigation is as satisfactory as in the simulation experiment.

Luo,2021,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,5,"A quadratic programming based neural dynamic (QPND) controller design method is proposed for time-varying trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Different from the traditional controller frameworks which only use pitch and roll angles to achieve the horizontal movement of the UAV, all the three attitude angles, i.e., roll, pitch and yaw angles, are applied for horizontal moving in this paper. There are at least three great superiorities of the proposed QPND controller. Firstly, three attitude angles can be coordinated control since the quadratic programming framework incorporates three attitudes. Secondly, the new framework enables the UAV to achieve the additional performance criteria or to perform subtasks.

Pilarski,2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR),IEEE Conferences,2,"Upper limb loss is a devastating injury for which current prosthetic replacement inadequately compensates. A lack of wrist movement in prostheses due to mechanical design and control system considerations compels prosthetic users to employ compensatory movements using their upper back and shoulder that can eventually result in strain and overuse injuries. One possible means of easing this control burden is to allow a prosthetic wrist to self-regulate, keeping the terminal device of the prosthesis level relative to the ground when appropriate, such as when raising a cup of liquid. This study aims to outline such a wrist control scheme, and evaluate its function in terms of the effect on compensatory movements, objective system performance, and subjective perception of system performance based on user feedback. To that end, twelve able-bodied participants were recruited to control a body-mounted robotic arm using three different control schemes: fixed-wrist (FW), sequential switching (SS), and automatic levelling (AL). The resulting movement strategies were recorded for two different tasks using 3D motion-capture. SS and AL control schemes induced similar movement strategies and less compensation than FW for horizontal movements, while AL reduced shoulder flexion compared to FW and SS for vertical movements. However, AL was ranked less intuitive and less reliable than the FW. AL and SS both seemed to involve more conscious thought to operate than FW. These results suggest that more complex wrist control schemes may indeed be able to eliminate harmful compensatory movements, but reinforce prior observations that control must be reliable and simple to use or people will opt for an easier system.",,,"Dept. of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Dept. of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan; Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital, Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Dept. of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"

Hui,2022,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,IEEE Journals,1,"The 3-D physical models for FeNi/Cu/FeNi films with two different types of structures that are linear and meander are developed. The relationship between the impedance of the films and the applied magnetic field or excitation frequency is obtained, and the influence of geometric parameters and structures of the films on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect is analyzed. The result shows that the GMI effect in the film with a horizontal meander structure appears to be much stronger compared with that in a linear structure. The negative mutual inductance of the meander FeNi/Cu/FeNi films reduces the total inductance and decreases the frequency response. Meanwhile, the GMI effect and the negative mutual inductance are enhanced by increasing the number of turns or decreasing the space width between each segment. Based on these effects, the FeNi/Cu/FeNi film with a vertical meander structure is proposed and simulated, which reflects the design of the meander structure in the thickness direction. The distance between each segment is reduced to 500 nm. The GMI effect and the negative mutual inductance are greatly enhanced (the maximum value of the GMI ratio increases from 207% to 1247% when the excitation frequency changes from 50 to 300 MHz).

Beauchamp,2022,2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO),IEEE Conferences,0,"Radar remote sensing is a powerful tool to characterize the subsurface structures here on Earth and at other planetary bodies. For scientific investigation of the surface and subsurface properties, the radar observations must be unambiguously localized at horizontal and vertical scales that resolve the characteristic features under investigation. Determining the source of the radar echoes either requires assumptions about the structure under investigation or the direction of the radar observation. The Mars sounders have illustrated that surface echoes contribute to a higher-than-expected level of contamination, which limits the radar's detection capabilities in the subsurface. The only effective way to limit the contamination is to focus the antenna's footprint by increasing the size of the aperture. Ice and subsurface radar sounder typically operate at low frequencies in the HF or VHF bands. To achieve an antenna footprint at kilometer scales from low Earth orbit (LEO), the length of the antenna aperture is of the order of kilometers. To effectively create this large antenna aperture and synthesize the desired footprint, the elements of the array must maintain a relative position to one another, and the position must be known accurately. The relative spacing between the elements determines the shape and level of the synthesized antenna's side-lobes (where the antenna pattern is ideally suppressed). The maximum extent of the array determines the resolution of the synthesized antenna's footprint. The number of elements decides the antenna gain, which ultimately increases the sensitivity of the radar. In this paper we study the dynamics of a tethered space system able to support the aforementioned antenna array. We consider an EndFire array made up of ten antenna elements, aligned along the local vertical thanks to gravity gradient stabilization. The modeling process is explored by steps. We expand a simple tether model by employing a discretized mass approach. The antenna elements are referred to as “climbers” and are constrained to the tether. Exact nonlinear dynamics are propagated with respect to the orbital frame of reference, according to the equations presented by Quadrelli in his works. Tethered formations have flown more often than free-flying spacecraft swarms and have proven to be much more stable and reliable. The presence of a mechanical link between the antenna elements leads to inexpensive formation reconfiguration maneuvers. Flexibility and reconfigurability are key for reusable space systems, so we propose a relative-position control system for multiple climbers and explore the topic of variable length tethers. The topics of attitude stabilization and optimal orbital correction maneuvers are also considered. We conclude with some considerations regarding scalability and simulation times.",,,"Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"

The whole process is based on an invariant EKF, which is proved in this paper to be able to preserve the correct observability of the system.

Abel,2021,2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),IEEE Conferences,0,"The autonomous landing of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a moving unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) demands precise spatial synchronization of both vehicle systems. A promising strategy to achieve a successful landing in this heterogeneous rendezvous maneuver is the subdivision of the synchronization control task into a trajectory planner and underlying trajectory tracking controllers. For this purpose, a central trajectory planner, which is the subject of this paper, computes feasible trajectories for the UAV and UGV that converge towards each other. Current approaches mainly rely either on computationally expensive optimization problems or on potentially inaccurate linearization. In this paper, a new model predictive trajectory planning scheme based on the flatness property of kinematic models of the fixed-wing UAV and UGV is presented. By using vehicle models with this property, quadratic programs (QP) are formulated that can be solved efficiently in each time instance without linearization of the nonlinear vehicle models, which is a novel approach in this application. Crucial requirements for the trajectory planner are that it reduces the horizontal distance between the vehicles to below 0.5 m while maintaining safety constraints to allow safe landing, and a sampling rate of 40 Hz to allow rapid replanning in case of disturbances. To overcome the issue of input constraint transformation between the original and the flat models, different approximation methods are investigated. Simulation results with simple kinematic vehicle models and high-fidelity dynamic models using underlying trajectory tracking controllers and navigation filters are presented that demonstrate that the proposed trajectory planning method allows safe landing maneuvers with the considered vehicle setup.",,,"Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Institute of Flight System Dynamics, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Institute of Flight System Dynamics, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"

Le,2023,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,0,"This paper introduces a new approach to stabilize the 6-DoF Overhead Crane by controlling its movements without requiring state measurements, using the separation principle. The movements of the system studied in this paper are described more closely than the existing crane model when considering six behaviors simultaneously: trolley and bridge movement, hoisting drum rotation, two swing angles along the  $x$ -axis and  $y$ -axis of the payload, and axial payload oscillation. The mission of the proposal is to make all the above behaviors of the 6-DOF crane system stable accurately enough at the desired positions and minimize both the horizontal swings of the payload and the axial oscillation of the cable by utilizing information about the position of the trolley, the bridge, and the length of cable. To guarantee these objectives, a cooperation regime controller comprising a new asymptotic state observer, which is elaborately constructed via a neural network, and the output feedback backstepping hierarchical sliding mode vehicle is integrated into the controller to improve the closed-loop system’s adaption. This cooperation controller has also evolved to prop up the fault injection data onslaught by eliminating all the information about the input system into the procedure.

Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of ∼70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by ∼95 and ∼30 times, which enables ∼25-fold and ∼56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/√h and 0.045 deg/√h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation.

Satellite selection is a useful way to relieve the side effect of superabundant measurements in use and has been developed for geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) optimization, but it has scarcely been studied in the integrity monitoring field. This paper proposes a slope-based fast satellite selection algorithm with the motivation to optimize the horizontal protection level (HPL) of subset while maintaining an acceptable positioning accuracy. The basis of this algorithm is a cost function which illustrates the relationship between satellite geometry and the slope effect. While the principle is to find the max slope satellite in the subset and introduce a new satellite which can significantly reduce the max slope by the cost function so the HPL decreases.

To address the above issues, a bilinear squeeze reasoning network is proposed for surgical image segmentation. In it, the space squeeze reasoning module is proposed, which adopts height pooling and width pooling to squeeze global contexts in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. The similarity between each horizontal position and each vertical position is calculated to encode long-range semantic dependencies and establish the affinity matrix. The feature maps are also squeezed from both the vertical and horizontal directions to model channel relations. Guided by channel relations, the affinity matrix is expanded to the same size as the input features.

Luo,2022,IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters,IEEE Journals,4,"This letter proposes a waveguide Magic-T operating in the  $W$ -band, aiming to overcome the assembly difficulties of conventional configuration. Its primary characteristic is that it allows for the one-piece fabrication of the waveguide cavity using popular computer numerical control (CNC) technology, avoiding the assembly of extra matching elements. Second, the four ports of the Magic-T share a horizontal plane, which allows its lid to theoretically be a flat plate. This overcomes the assembly misalignment challenge, due to the presence of port in the lid of some conventional Magic-T. In addition, the use of bed-of-nails to package this Magic-T was investigated to further alleviate the difficulty of assembly.

Unlike conventional fixed-wing aircraft or multirotor drones, the flight dynamics of the hybrid aircraft are influenced by both sets of propulsion systems – the main petrol engine and the 4 fixed-rotors. Hence, a derivation of the flight dynamics is presented here as a result of the contribution from both propulsion systems. For this initial attempt, the main petrol engine is fixed at its location and has the sole purpose of providing horizontal thrust only. The position of the petrol engine is located along the X-body axis hence, no moment is created about the center of gravity (CG) by the main horizontal thrust. The 4 fixed rotors, on the other hand, provide vertical thrust along the Z-body axis with the associated roll and yaw. All 4-rotors are positioned on the same X-Y plane on the aircraft body axis.

1020,Facial Expression Recognition With Confidence Guided Refined Horizontal Pyramid Network,W. Su; H. Zhang; Y. Su; J. Yu,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,1,"Facial expression recognition has become one of the most studied applications in computer vision and human-computer interaction. Part-level features constitute one the most appealing breakthrough to offer fine-grained information and have been intensively studied consequently. The main prerequisite is accurate location of facial parts with additional cues, which is turned to be another difficulty. Rather than directly locating parts, this paper proposes a confidence guided Refined Horizontal Pyramid Network (RHPN) to fully exploit various partial information of a given facial image. It can learn discriminative features with multiple facial granularities. Inconsistencies within each granularity are efficiently limited. Specifically, we first design a Horizontal Pyramid Network (HPN) for classification using the uniform partial feature representations at different horizontal pyramid scales. It successfully enhances the discriminative capabilities of various facial parts. Then, a refinement mechanism is added to HPN due to the fact that the uniform partition inevitably incurs outliers in each part and introduces unreasonable similarity between different parts. It re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in the refined parts with enhanced within-stripe consistency. Due to the lack of explicit supervisory information, we design an induced training strategy additionally for efficiently training of RHPN. For avoiding the finagle of prediction based on the separate feature vector, we prefer the confidence guided prediction as the final classification result. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our network for increasing the performance on facial expression recognition. More importantly, it surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the lab-controlled Oulu-CASIA dataset and the real world RAF-DB dataset.",Facial expression recognition;local feature learning;content consistency;multiple granularities,,"Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; School of Optoelectronic Engineering, Xi’an University of Technology, Xi’an, China; Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"

The control law design for this method is determined by the structural properties of the network, as well as the dynamic characteristics in the nodes, and the simple choice of a coupling constant.

This paper proposes schemes for postural transition and robust posture control, thus enabling quadruped robots to trot on horizontal and slanted surfaces. For a region connected by surfaces with different angles, the postural transition scheme (PTS) is implemented by the movement values optimized by a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), which regulates the location of the center of gravity (COG) projection point of robots. In addition, the movement values are applied to the center points of the desired foot trajectories by using cubic polynomial, which is able to generate adaptive foot motion continuously and gradually. For robust posture control, admittance control with impedance modulation (IM) is applied to the foot trajectories, which changes the impedance parameters in real-time depending on the magnitude of the disturbances, such as the excessive swaying of the robot body that cause instabilities in the robot posture during locomotion. Control thresholds regulated by the angular speed of the robot body are proposed as a criterion for controlling the excessive swaying by IM.

Naicker,2022,2022 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering (CSDE),IEEE Conferences,0,"Challenging and unreachable tasks such as inspection and maintenance of equipment often require a robot to reach high, hidden, or confined areas that are difficult for humans to access. Such regular, repetitive tasks can be performed more efficiently if automated. This paper presents the derivation of kinematic equations of a new linear robotic system comprising an n-link prismatic arm on an automated slider that undergoes horizontal motion along a rail mounted on a fixed solid base at both ends. While moving linearly along the horizontally placed rail, the mobile slider facilitates reachability by placing the end-effector and allowing access to an arbitrary target to accomplish assigned tasks. Based on the work requirements, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ rigid links can be attached to the robotic arm system for reaching high places and positioning the end-effector to reach remote targets in a workspace. Motion controllers in the form of autonomous acceleration controllers are derived for both the mobile slider and the prismatic arm using the Lyapunov based Control Scheme (LbCS).

Aglzim,2023,2023 14th International Conference on Mechanical and Intelligent Manufacturing Technologies (ICMIMT),IEEE Conferences,0,"Quadcopters are a type of drone with four rotors that are used for a variety of purposes, such as freight transportation, military surveillance, and aerial photography. However, when operating around obstacles and in the proximity of walls or moving objects, the aerial vehicle can be subject to external forces that can cause severe flight instability. To address this issue, a methodology based on multiple reference frame (MRF) tetrahedral meshes is developed in this paper and applied to computational simulations to study the downwash flow generated by a quadcopter propeller over fixed and moving obstacles. The effects of different rotational speeds and moving obstacle proximity are assessed and compared to experimental data and theoretical models. The results show that the presence of fixed and moving obstacles can have a significant impact on the aerodynamic performance of the propeller, leading to changes in lift force and the formation of turbulent vortices and flow separation zones. When hovering at 3000, 5000, and 9550 rpm, the results showed an increase in the lift force on the propeller by 9.3%, and 1.03% compared to open rotor thrust due to the presence of a fixed obstacle (wall) placed at 0.1 m and 0.2 m from the propeller respectively. However, when hovering (3000 rpm) at 0.2 m above a moving obstacle (5 m/s, and 10 m/s) the results have shown an increase in the lift by 1.92% for 5 m/s moving obstacle, and then a decrease by 4.4% for 10 m/s, comparing to fixed obstacle thrust.

Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time EIS algorithm suitable for spherical robot, according to the characteristics of it. The algorithm divides the task into three subtasks: rotation correction, vertical translation correction and horizontal translation correction. Information from inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used to correct the rotation. Vertical translation correction is based on IMU information, and supplemented by gray projection method.

Gopura,2021,"2021 7th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)",IEEE Conferences,0,"This paper proposes a robotic lower extremity exoskeleton for maintaining the balance of a paraplegic patient during walking gait. Stable gait is achieved by actuating five degrees-of-freedom per leg and by adopting a gait pattern based on a variation of the nonlinear inverted pendulum model. The exoskeleton allows the shifting of the center of mass in the horizontal plane to maintain a positive margin of stability during the walking gait cycle. A mathematical model was developed to determine the design specifications of the exoskeleton, i.e., model dimensions and actuator performance, to achieve a desired margin of stability and dynamic balance control. The simulation results indicate that the exoskeleton is successful in maintaining a stable gait with a low positive dynamic margin of stability of 15 mm at a chosen speed of 0.15 m/s. However, to address the limitations of the standalone exoskeleton such as recovering balance following perturbations and the need for actuators with higher bandwidth for meeting an actively balanced gait, a compact support structure is introduced as an accessory to the proposed exoskeleton. The additional structure included increases the margin of stability while partially supporting the weight of the user and exoskeleton, while allowing a natural gait cycle. The structure is comparable to a wheelchair in terms of form factor while offering greater level of health benefits and safety compared to a standalone lower extremity exoskeleton. According to the simulation results, the minimum margin of stability during walking gait can be increased to 230 mm, with a supporting structure.

The employed robot platform has six actively articulated wheels that can be independently controlled. More precisely, each wheel of the robot is attached to a hub using the three-bar linkage mechanism, where one of the links is realized in the form of an electric linear actuator that can extend or retract to drop or lift the corresponding wheel following an arc curve, respectively. Our goal is to devise a control strategy to simultaneously command all six linear actuators such that the robot can keep stable when traversing rough terrains. To this end, we equip the robot with an IMU sensor to monitor the status of the chassis during driving the robot.

The problem was simplified to the well-known cart-and-pendulum system moving on a horizontal line. This model was implemented in a virtual environment and human subjects manipulated the object via a robotic manipulandum. The task was to maneuver the system from rest to arrive at a target position such that no residual oscillations of the pendulum bob remained. Our goal was to test whether humans simplified control by employing dynamic primitives, specifically submovements. Experimental velocity profiles of the human movements were compared to those predicted by three different control models. Two models used continuous optimization-based control, the third control model was based on Input Shaping. Input Shaping is a method for controlling flexible objects by convolving a motion profile with impulses of appropriate amplitude and timing. To evaluate whether humans used Input Shaping, we decomposed the velocity profiles recorded from humans into submovements, as proxies for the convolved impulses. Comparing the motion profiles from the 3 models with the experimentally measured human profiles showed superior performance of the Input Shaping model. These initial results are consistent with our hypothesis that combining dynamic primitives, submovements, is a competent description of human performance and may provide a simpler alternative to computationally complex optimization-based methods of robot control.",,,"Computer Science Dept., Univ. of California, Santa Barbara; Computer Science Dept., Univ. of California, Santa Barbara; Computer Science Dept., Univ. of California, Santa Barbara; Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics, California State Univ., Long Beach"

Anyway, its global convergence proof is rather cumbersome, which hinders the extension of the method and proof to time-delayed and/or uncertain systems. In this letter, we illustrate that the circle criterion can be used as an alternative method to prove the global convergence of the I&I estimator. This also opens up the inclusion of time-delays and uncertainties. First, we demonstrate that the I&I wind speed estimator is equivalent to a torque balance estimator with a proportional correction term. As the nonlinearity in the estimator is sector bounded, the well-known circle criterion is applied to the estimator to guarantee its global convergence for time-delayed systems. By looking at the theoretical framework from this new perspective, this letter further proposes the addition of an integrator to the correction term to improve the estimator performance. Case studies show that the proposed estimator with an additional integral correction term is effective at wind speed estimation.

Large-scale PV-based MMC suffers from leg–leg and arm–arm power mismatch issues, leading to unbalanced power injection into ac grid. To inject balanced power into the ac grid, this article proposes a novel control technique, which minimizes the circulating current in the converter. A novel two fundamental frequency zero-sequence voltages injection technique is proposed for a leg–leg (horizontal) power mismatch by which the dc circulating current from the MMC legs can be minimized significantly. Simultaneously, an independent arm power control technique is proposed for an arm–arm (vertical) power mismatch, thereby minimizing the ac circulating current. With the proposed control strategies, overcurrent and subsequent losses in the converter due to circulating current can be reduced. Both horizontal and vertical power mismatch problems are theoretically analyzed and solved through the proposed technique to make the MMC more promising for large-scale PV applications where mismatched power generation is common.

This article presents a novel method for the online measurement of the mass flow rate of pulverized fuel through acoustic emission (AE) detection and electrostatic sensing. An integrated sensing head with an AE probe and three sets of electrostatic sensor arrays is developed. The proposed method determines the particle velocity by multichannel cross correlation of the electrostatic signals and extracts the information about mass flow rate from the AE signal arising from impacts of particles with a waveguide protruding into the flow. An analytical model that relates the energy of the AE signals, the particle velocity, and the mass flow rate is established. The sensing head was mounted on the vertical and horizontal sections of a 72-mm bore laboratory-scale test rig conveying fine silica particles. Experimental tests were conducted under a range of flow conditions and installation orientations to assess the performance of the developed measurement system. The results demonstrate that the sensing head should be installed in any orientation away from the elbow on the vertical section of a pipe, while for installation on a horizontal pipe, the waveguide should be in the horizontal direction. The instrumentation system is capable of measuring the mass flow rate of particles in the vertical pipe with a relative error within ±6.5% regardless of the orientation of the sensing head over the mass flow rate from 7 to 25 kg/h and the particle velocity from 12 to 30 m/s, while on the horizontal pipe, the error is within 5.8% when the sensing head is installed with the waveguide in the horizontal direction under the same flow conditions.",Acoustic emission (AE);electrostatic sensor;mass flow rate;particle flow;pneumatic conveying,,"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Kent, U.K.; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"

System under investigation consisted of dual fan module that is interlinked and its axis moving freely in the pitch plan. On the other hand, a counter weight was used to balance the two fans thrust to optimize the controller effort in the elevation plan. The counterweight axe was denoted as the elevation axis. If the fans are not on the same horizontal line, the rotation of the system around itself in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction was carried out around the travel axis. The LQR controller design parameters should be able to stabilize itself at any degree on the travel or elevation axes while maintaining hover level along the pitch axis. Such controller acts by defining the penalty of each type of error in controlling this system. The error was multiplied by relevant penalty, then fed-back to the controller that controls the fan speeds accordingly. The representing model had three axes, each have a proportional, derivative, and integral term for the travel and elevation axes but not the pitch axis, the reasons will be discussed later in the paper.

To not only fully exploit the 3D multiplexing but also circumvent the size limitation of base station (BS), antenna elements in massive MIMO are usually arranged both horizontally and vertically. Based on an elaborate channel measurement campaign conducted at 11 GHz in a lobby environment, a 3D extended cluster-based channel model is proposed in this paper for massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) multi-user communications. In the model, the channel characteristics in both azimuth and elevation dimensions, and the visibility regions which are parametrized by observed cluster lengths across the large-scale array in both horizontal and vertical directions, are taken into consideration. Moreover, the spherical wavefront phenomenon observed from the measurements is also incorporated in the model. Model parametrization, implementation, and validation are presented in detail. Validations show that the proposed model can accurately reflect the realistic channel, and the spatial non-stationarity and the spherical wavefront should be carefully considered in the channel models for large-scale array communications.",Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);3D MIMO;5G;channel measurement;cluster evolution;non-stationarity;visibility region;spherical wavefront,,"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K.; China Academy of Telecommunication Research, Beijing, China"

Real-time monitoring of flow status evolution is helpful to the safe operation. The progress of multi-sensor technology makes it possible to accurately measure the flow information, which lays a data foundation for the establishment of flow status monitoring model. Due to the instability and randomness of flow, there are both nonstationary and stationary signals in the measurement data. In this paper, the augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is used to distinguish nonstationary signals from stationary signals. Cointegration analysis (CA) can deal with the problem that the fluctuation of nonstationary signals masks the change trend of flow status. For stationary signals, kernel canonical variate analysis (KCVA) is used to realize the nonlinear mapping and obtain the canonical features reflecting the dynamic changes. Two monitoring indexes are built and combined to monitor the flow status. CA- KCVA method is applied to the data of gas-water two-phase flow in horizontal pipe.

The 12-element linear array has been designed with the controlled beam tilt from 13° to 19°, since the main beam should be directed to the area below base station. A novel modification of cast metal crossed dipoles is used as an array element. To obtain stable 90° half power beamwidth the special metal walls around the dipoles have been introduced into design as well as the vertical walls at the edges of the plane reflector behind the dipoles. Due to these modifications proposed linear array shows high characteristics: measured beamwidth in horizontal plane by the tilt of beam up to 19° is on average 87°, the beamwidth in vertical plane is 7.3°, gain is 16.3 dB, the reflection loss is less than -17 dB, the isolation is better than -29 dB, the cross-polarization component is less than -17 dB.

The observer is easily tunable by the user, with a set of four scalars, two of them related to the velocity of convergence of the estimator, and other two parameters to set the desired tradeoff between noise sensitivity and disturbance rejection.

Wang,2022,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,IEEE Journals,4,"In recent years, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm has received considerable attention because of its excellent performance in many challenging tasks. However, there is still a large space for theoretical explanation of the mechanism of PPO’s horizontal clipping operation, which is a key means to improve the performance of PPO. In addition, while PPO is inspired by the learning theory of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), the theoretical connection between PPO’s clipping operation and TRPO’s trust region constraint has not been well studied. In this article, we first analyze the effect of PPO’s clipping operation on the objective function of conservative policy iteration, and strictly give the theoretical relationship between PPO and TRPO. Then, a novel first-order policy gradient algorithm called authentic boundary PPO (ABPPO) is proposed, which is based on the authentic boundary setting rule. To ensure the difference between the new and old policies is better kept within the clipping range, by borrowing the idea of ABPPO, we proposed two novel improved PPO algorithms called rollback mechanism-based ABPPO (RMABPPO) and penalized point policy difference-based ABPPO (P3DABPPO), which are based on the ideas of rollback clipping and penalized point policy difference, respectively. Experiments on the continuous robotic control tasks implemented in MuJoCo show that our proposed improved PPO algorithms can effectively improve the learning stability and accelerate the learning speed compared with the original PPO.",Authentic boundary;penalized point policy difference;proximal policy optimization (PPO);reinforcement learning (RL);rollback clipping,,"Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Control for Underground Space, Ministry of Education, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China; Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Control for Underground Space, Ministry of Education, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China; Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Control for Underground Space, Ministry of Education, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"

In this manuscript, we tackle this challenge for energy load consumption forecasting in regards to REPs which is essential to energy demand management, load balancing and infrastructure planning. Specifically, we note that existing energy load forecasting is centralized, which are not scalable and most importantly, is vulnerable to data privacy threats. Besides, REPs are individual market participants and liable to ensure the privacy of their own customers. To address this issue, we propose a novel horizontal privacy-preserving federated learning framework for REPs energy load forecasting, namely FedREP. We consider a differential privacy-based federated learning system consisting of a control centre and multiple retailers by enabling multiple REPs to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing critical issues such as data privacy, data security and scalability. For forecasting, we use a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network due to its ability to learn long term sequences of observations and promises of higher accuracy with time-series data while solving the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real energy consumption dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed federated learning framework can achieve sufficient performance in terms of MSE ranging between 0.3 to 0.4 and is relatively similar to that of a centralized approach while preserves privacy and improves scalability.",Smart grid;energy internet;load forecasting;federated learning;privacy;neural network;LSTM;differential privacy,,"Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CSRI), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia; Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CSRI), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia; Centre for Smart Power and Energy Research (CSPER), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia; Centre for Smart Power and Energy Research (CSPER), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia; Department of Computer Science & IT, Latrobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia; Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CSRI), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"

Zhang,2020,2020 39th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),IEEE Conferences,1,"In the fields of big data, signal analysis and smart grid, the calculations of similarity or distance between two time series are commonly employed. Most of the signals (time series) in the real world are fluctuating and noised. The similarity between the two signals is usually a compound outcome synthesized from their fluctuating components and deterministic components. For example, the well-known Pearson correlation coefficient is mainly the similarity between the fluctuating components in the two actual signals, and has a large confidence interval. In this paper, the basic properties of six common similarity indices, i.e., the Pearson correlation coefficient, the cosine similarity, the Tanimoto similarity, the Dice similarity, the mutual information and the maximal information coefficient (MIC), are studied. Their confidence intervals for the signals with a standard normal distribution random component are numerically simulated. If the original signals are z-score normalized, the confidence intervals of the Tanimoto similarity and the Dice similarity are often smaller than those of the Pearson correlation coefficient, the cosine similarity, the mutual information and the maximal information coefficient. As a practical example of their applications, for a horizontal axis wind turbine, the optimal statistical time period of ""wind speed - output electrical power"" time series obtained by the six similarity indices is consistent with that obtained by the mechanism analysis.",Big data;Signal analysis;Similarity;Normal distribution;Confidence interval;Wind power,,"School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Huadian Nanjiang Thermal Power Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"

Laser footprints generally have decimeter-level vertical accuracy, meeting the requirement of ground elevation control points. In contrast, the footprint horizontal geolocation accuracy is in the meter to ten-meter levels. Although previous researches attempted to locate the footprint horizontal coordinate based on the digital surface model (DSM), the applicability and performance of the DSM-based positioning method in evaluating the footprint geolocation accuracy should be rigorously assessed before large-scale applications. Therefore, this study practices the DSM-based footprint positioning method over several study sites with various land covers and different laser campaigns. The footprint geolocation accuracy of the ICESat/GLAS (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System), the first Earth observation full-waveform LiDAR satellite, is evaluated by the DSM-based method. Results indicate that the DSM-based positioning method is only suitable for areas with significant height features, but not applicable in areas with high spatial correlation. The derived footprint geolocation accuracy (8.19-m horizontal shifting with 4.19-m standard deviation) is relatively reliable in urban site with relatively high spatial heterogeneity.

Kolar,2022,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",IEEE Journals,5,"Stabilization of the position and orientation of non-spherical, sub-wavelength particles in mid-air is required for using acoustic levitation forces in applications such as automation of micro manufacturing processes, 3-D scanning, and inspection. Acoustic locking has previously been demonstrated by time-multiplexing of different acoustic traps at the same frequency. In this case, the magnitude of the acoustic levitation forces and the stabilizing torque are coupled by the ratio of the durations during which the different traps are applied and cannot be adjusted independently assuming operation at maximum power. This work presents a compact device that uses a method for independently adjusting the vertical trapping forces and the stabilizing torque using two different ultrasonic frequencies. A 40-kHz vertical standing wave is used to generate levitation forces that counteract the gravitational force. Additionally, a 25-kHz horizontal standing wave is used to generate a tunable stabilizing torque. Using this method, objects made from high-density materials across a wide range of geometries can be locked acoustically with increased stability compared with state-of-the-art methods. This is demonstrated by locking tin cuboids with a density of 7.3 g/cm3 and plastic cuboids with average side lengths between 0.9 and 3.5 mm.

Aggregated load profiles are produced by replicating a 50 litre (50% capacity) draw event for a 100-litre dual-mountable electric water heater (EWH) for each orientation. A total of 416 load profiles are produced containing 208 sets of horizontal and vertical aggregated profiles for comparison. Two factors are varied, (1) total EWH population from 1 to 1 million in various increments and (2) peak time window for initiating EWH draws ranging from 1 to 12 hours, where a Gaussian distribution is applied to the times each EWH starts participating on the grid. The resulting aggregated load profiles show that EWHs in the vertical orientation produce a higher aggregated maximum demand whereas the horizontal orientation can have a much lower aggregated maximum demand to a ratio of 0.58. A maximum demand ratio Ph/Pv of 0.80 is determined for a scenario similar to normal grid operation for a peak time window of 4 hours.

One of the most straightforward and inexpensive way to actuate soft robots is using compressed air. This light and powerful energy source supports a good response time. However, air compressibility and flexibility of soft robots tends to significant challenges in the precise position control of the robot. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are other types of actuators with unique characteristics. Simple actuation, being lightweight and high force-to-weight ratio are suitable properties of SMA for such application. In this paper, a fiber-reinforced prototype of a soft robotic module made of silicone rubber with a semicircular cross-section is developed. By employing shape memory alloy springs on the body of the soft robotic module, precise control of bending in the vertical plane is achieved. In addition, the degree of freedom in the horizontal surplus plane is increased. For position control of the robot in the workspace, a simple closed loop controller is used along with a couple of cameras to measure the angular displacement of the robot in both vertical and horizontal planes. Based on the obtained results, it has been demonstrated that more accurate controllability and a larger workspace are provided using the shape memory alloy springs.",Soft robots;Actuator;Compressed Air;Shape Memory Alloys;Position Control,,"Dept. of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran; Dept. of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran; Dept. of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"

The interaction of dry friction with the elastic forces is considered during the sliding of a body over a rough plane. A pulling lateral force is applied to the center of mass of the body. In the process of motion, sliding of one or two supports is possible. The corresponding dynamical system is a variable structure system. A condition is found for one of the supports to fall into the friction cone and then stop for some finite time. It is shown that the body with elastic supports performs slipping with the non-zero horizontal speed, even if the lateral force is less, the minimum required for the sliding of a solid (non-rigid) body with dry friction.",dry friction;elastic support;pulling lateral force;stick-slip motion in sliding;variable structure system,,"Laboratory of Navigation and Control, Institute of Mechanics of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia"

Time series analysis provides an efficient way to map temporal patterns, like hourly, monthly, yearly, and seasonal variations, and within solar irradiance data. In this paper, time series forecasting of 24hourly future observations of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is done using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of deep learning framework. Different hyperparameters like hidden layers, hidden units of each layer, activation function, optimizer, and lag observations/steps are tuned to develop the best model that fits the GHI historical data.

Yang,2022,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",IEEE Journals,1,"The control of acoustic field has great potential in many applications such as medical treatment, neuro-modulation, and bio-imaging. Recently, acoustic lenses and phased arrays have become common ways of controlling acoustic fields. However, the shortcomings of the two ways are obvious. Acoustic lenses lack flexibility after design, and phased arrays have complicated structures and need to adjust the parameters of each array element. In this work, we propose an alternative for sound field control using a flexible and adjustable “acoustic projector,” and two symmetric mirrors are used to change the direction of propagation of an acoustic wave produced by a piezoelectric element and realize acoustic focusing in the target region. The 2-D “acoustic projector” model was built in finite element simulation, and the feasibility was verified with an actual prototype. The sound intensity produced by the piezoelectric element at different horizontal and vertical positions along the target area can be accurately controlled by two adjustable mirrors. When the angle of the mirror ranges from 30° to 40°, the focal depth can change from 39 to 140 mm. Furthermore, the focus can be controlled in a sector with an angle of 60°. The “acoustic projector” demonstrates simple but precise control of acoustic fields and may broaden their applicability.

Rogozinnikov,2020,2020 3rd International Youth Scientific and Technical Conference on Relay Protection and Automation (RPA),IEEE Conferences,0,"A prototype of the distributed control system was developed, which executes power loss optimization task for a specific part of the power grid. The control system calculates optimal states of reactive power compensators and voltage regulators, without using of a common data collection point. The distributed power loss optimization is achieved by dividing of the specific grid part into energy clusters (groups of energy facilities) according to geographical, economic or other principals. Every energy cluster is represented by an agent which receives measurements within its own area (energy cluster) and is able to request measurements from adjoin to the energy cluster substations of other clusters. Based on these measurements, the agent creates equivalents of the external grid and implements local (inside one energy cluster) optimization. Every agent executes this optimization task and then a negotiation process begins. During the negotiation process an optimal for all energy clusters mode is defined.The distributed system has a three-level architecture:–The upper level. The level contains energy cluster agents, which interact to each other and determine the optimal mode for every energy cluster and for the whole part of a grid.–The middle level. The level performs collection of equipment sates within the energy cluster and sends commands to equipment, which were defined during high level optimization process.–The lower level. The level contains local regulators of substations to keep determined power mode during diurnal cycle.The upper level optimizes the operation mode of the energy cluster group by agent communication. This process is a trading process among agents, in which the reactive power compensators states and voltages at the boundary substation of energy clusters are iteratively changed to determine a mode with minimal active power losses.The middle level represents an interaction of power equipment agents. The agents collect information about the current state and send it to upper level agent. When the state of the energy cluster has been determined during optimization process, voltage setpoints for every substation are sent back. The power equipment agents receive voltage setpoint and determine states of reactive power compensators and voltage regulators to implement the setpoint.The lower level of the system is aimed to maintain determined operation mode during diurnal cycle. It contains substation regulators, which controls installed reactive power compensators and voltage regulation equipment (tap-changers).The developed system has the following advantages:–Self-configuration of the system: the applied approach allows automatically detecting topology changes and rebuilding the operation of algorithms without additional human intervention.–Easy horizontal scaling: if a new energy cluster is added to the system, all its neighbors will automatically detect this agent and take it into account for the next optimization.–The system does not require a central point of data collection and storage. Thus, the communication channel requirements are reduced. Communication by GPS and GLONASS can be used for agent communication.",,,"Relay Protection and Automation of Power Systems Department, National Research University «MPEI», Moscow, Russia; Relay Protection and Automation of Power Systems Department, National Research University «MPEI», Moscow, Russia; Relay Protection and Automation of Power Systems Department, National Research University «MPEI», Moscow, Russia; Relay Protection and Automation of Power Systems Department, National Research University «MPEI», Moscow, Russia; Relay Protection and Automation of Power Systems Department, National Research University «MPEI», Moscow, Russia"

However, they still have a velocity limitation on fast descent maneuvers, which is known as Vortex Ring State (VRS) constraint in the literature. In this paper, first, we provide a brief description of VRS, and formalize a constraint on the quadcopter's velocity regarding the VRS. Then a novel control strategy using the yaw rate has been suggested to avoid the VRS velocity constraint. Finally, the motion of the quadcopter and the proposed controller are examined in both simulation and experiment, and the performance of the system in avoiding the unstable VRS region in a fast descent maneuver is demonstrated. The quadcopter's equations of motion and the Yaw Rate Controller (YRC) are simulated in the Matlab/Simulink software. The experiments show that the quadcopter can descend about three times faster than the regular descent maneuvers, using the YRC algorithm without any instability. This is due to the creation of horizontal airflow on the blade disk by the yaw rate maneuver. By using this algorithm, quadcopters can descend faster to save their flight endurance for their main mission goal. Moreover, since this method guarantees the stability of quadcopters in pure descents, the drone can be used in chimneys inspections.",Motion control;aerial systems: Mechanics and control;quadcopter vortex ring state;VRS avoiding controller;yaw rate control,,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran; School of Mechanical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran; School of Mechanical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"

Lai,2022,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,IEEE Journals,9,"The precise location of insulators in infrared images is of great significance for insulator condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Due to the characteristics of insulators themselves and the use of handheld infrared cameras, insulators usually appear in infrared images with different aspect ratios and main axis orientations. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to make full use of the prior knowledge of the insulator itself to accurately locate it. However, most of the existing methods use axial horizontal detection boxes to detect insulators, which cannot take into account the characteristics of the insulator well. When there are large overlapping areas of two horizontal detection boxes, the nonmaximum suppression algorithm may lead to missed detection of the object. To further improve the accuracy of the detection algorithm, this article makes full use of the prior features carried by the insulator itself, and optimizes faster region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) from five aspects: rectangular box representation, feature extraction, candidate box generation, anchor design, and feature alignment. An oriented detection model for infrared images of insulators is constructed. Comparative experiments with a variety of mainstream detection methods were carried out on the constructed infrared dataset. The results show that the proposed method is superior to other models in detection accuracy. When the intersection and union ratio is 0.5, the average precision reaches 95.08%.

1108,Challenges and Possible Solutions with Multibeam Calibration Surveys in Very Shallow Waters,A. Hiroji; J. O. Oguntuase,2021,OCEANS 2021: San Diego – Porto,IEEE Conferences,1,"Multibeam calibration surveys are an integral part of hydrographic surveys and must be performed to the highest possible accuracy to avoid systematic errors in the hydrographic data. The calibration surveys are performed to calculate position latency and roll, pitch, yaw angular misalignment between the motion sensor and the sonar. In very shallow waters, the computation of calibration values is challenging, as the accumulated errors in seafloor depth and position, from all contributing factors, including horizontal and vertical controls, approach resolvability of the calibration method. The horizontal control of any multibeam survey is derived from GNSS aided inertial navigation system. For the vertical control, the ellipsoidally referenced survey (ERS) relies on the height derived from the GNSS-aided inertial navigation system, while the tidally referenced surveys (TRS) rely on the observed or predicted tides. The positioning and motion data are commonly post-processed to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Any errors in the positioning of the survey vessel affect the multibeam calibration values and introduce systematic errors in the entire data set. This paper accesses the relative accuracies of multibeam calibration values when using ERS and TRS. The paper also looks at the effect of horizontal and vertical positioning errors from different GNSS processing strategies on the multibeam calibration values through field experiments. This experiment and followed investigations aim to identify the achievable accuracies in the GNSS and motion data post-processing domain as reflected in ERS and its impact on multibeam calibration. An experiment was set up to obtain calibration values for three different multibeam calibration data sets for twelve unique cases of multibeam data processing strategies.

The broadcast ephemeris orbit, broadcast clock offset correction and user differential range error (UDRE) parameters are estimated with recursive least square algorithm by using observation data of the 1s sampling rate from 19 stations in China region. The pseudo range residual jump can be weakened when satellite enters and leaves region by applying the quality control algorithm based on fast arrangement sliding window of normal median. Besides the real satellite orbit error and clock offset error are compared with broadcast ephemeris orbit and broadcast clock offset correction, which shows superior performance in consistency. The envelope experiment is conducted based on UDRE, with results aligning with its definition, which meets the integrity requirements. The enhanced single point positioning is conducted by using broadcast ephemeris orbit, clock offset correction and integrity parameters, in which the Klobuchar model is utilized to calculate the ionosphere delay.

Luo,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,3,"Georeferencing satellite imagery is the basis for mapping and other subsequent processing in photogrammetry and remote sensing. Traditional georeferencing methods, which require adequate and well-distributed ground control points (GCPs), are time-consuming, costly, constantly cumbersome and inefficient. This study proposes a method of adaptive re-weighted block adjustment without GCPs for satellite stereo images. Furthermore, an approach of using multi-coverage images to improve the direct georeferencing accuracy is also investigated. The bias-compensated rational function model with affine transformation parameters is used as the adjustment mathematical model. The “weighted virtual control points” are introduced as constraints in the adjustment. Space intersection and resection are executed iteratively to solve the accurate affine transformation parameters. A total of 722 three-line array stereo scenes of Chinese Mapping Satellite-1 images captured from December 2010 to March 2016, which cover the entire Shandong Province of China (about 158,000 km2) nearly 10 times in space, are used as experimental data to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the systematic errors of images. Moreover, the additional comparison with experiments of three groups of mono-coverage images indicates that the redundant observations from multi-coverage images can significantly improve the direct georeferencing accuracy, more specifically, from 13.69-16.02 m to 11.09 m in the horizontal direction, and from 16.39-29.27 m to 8.47 m in the vertical direction.",Georeferencing satellite imagery;block adjustment;without ground control points (GCPs);multi-coverage satellite images;weighted virtual control points,,"School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory for Aerial Remote Sensing Technology of Ministry of Natural Resources of the People’s Republic of China, Beijing, China"

The process of starting and braking the bridge mechanism is accompanied by the swinging of the load, which has a negative impact on the mechanism as a whole. This process can be weakened by providing a soft start and soft braking, using a ramp-function generator in the drive control system. The proposed technique also leads to a decrease in the values of the dynamic moment, load oscillations, by making the necessary adjustments in a given range of the transient process.

The development of RIS-assisted communication technology relies on deep understanding of RIS channel characteristics. However, most of the existing investigations focus on the impact of RIS, ignoring the existence of local scatterers in the real propagation environment. The ideal propagation condition limits the accuracy and application of the developed channel model. In this paper, we aim to analyze the channel characteristics of RIS-assisted near-filed communication by considering different conditions of local scatterers. Specifically, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model based on a three-dimensional cylinder model, which considers line-of-sight, single-bounced at RIS (SBR) and double-bounced (DB) modes where radio waves reflect from RIS and scatterers near receiver. Based on the proposed channel model, we investigate some key statistical properties for SBR and DB propagation, including the time-frequency-space correlation function and Doppler power spectrum. From the simulation results, it is found that RIS element number, RIS horizontal and vertical locations, distribution of surrounding scatterers, and movement of Rx have significant impacts on channel characteristics. Finally, channel capacities of SBR and DB modes are calculated, where the large size and appropriate locations of RIS significantly improve the channel capacity of RIS-assisted communication.

Determining the relations between the functional axes of a joint and the local coordinate system of the attached sensor is a crucial requirement. For the case of hinge joints, methods have been proposed that exploit kinematic constraints to automatically identify the local hinge joint axis coordinates from the raw data of almost arbitrary motions. However, to current date, it remains unclear which joint motions are sufficiently rich for the joint axis to become identifiable. We consider a commonly used gyroscope-based kinematic constraint and present a novel accelerometer-based kinematic constraint. We study conditions of identifiability by analyzing the nonlinear constraint equations and present practical conditions for the minimum excitation that is required. Among other results, we prove that planar motions and subsequent motions of both ends of the joint are sufficient as long as the joint axis does not remain perfectly horizontal. Theoretical results are validated in experimental studies of a human upper limb wearing an exoskeleton. Despite the typical IMU-related measurement inaccuracies and although the human elbow joint is only an approximate hinge joint, the cost function defined by the kinematic constraints exhibits a distinct global minimum at the true joint axis coordinates if the motion fulfills the proposed requirements.",,,"Control Systems Group, Technische Universität Berlin; Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands; Control Systems Group, Technische Universität Berlin"

New emerging concepts aim to streamline ROV operations by utilizing unmanned surface vessels of a smaller size. Reduction in size may result in first-order wave induced motion being more significant. This motivates the use of dynamic positioning control using thrusters to actively compensate for first-order wave-driven horizontal-plane motion in order to maximize operability. This article proposes a controller for dynamic positioning based on model predictive control and short-term wave motion prediction intended to actively compensate for first-order waves. By considering the full dynamic sea environment, the controller is able to dampen out some of the oscillatory motion caused by first-order waves. The controller is able reduce the average deviation from the set-point with up to 65% for a variety of sea conditions. The maximum distance error to the reference point is reduced by up to 65% depending on sea state. The dynamics of the thrusters is a limiting factor when counteracting first-order waves and fast thrusters are therefore crucial in achieving best possible positioning.

By adapting intelligent foot placement strategies found in dynamically stable hopping robots, this work proposes a strategy involving carefully managed intentional collisions between the UAS and its environment. We designed an attitude controller denoted a Velocity Matching controller that aligns a UAS-mounted pogo-stick foot with the center of mass velocity vector during collision approach to maximize UAS ability to recover a hover state after collision. We propose the use of a flight envelope involving altitude and horizontal speed states to assess recoverability prior to initiating each approach to collision. We identify this flight envelope from a simulation study built on a model of flight in Conventional Waypoint Following and Velocity Matching control modes as well as a model of collision response.

1139,Demand Reduction of Electric Water Heaters for Load-Shedding Recovery using Stochastic Control,L. L. Chiloane; G. K. Kirui; Y. -C. J. Yen,2021,2021 IEEE AFRICON,IEEE Conferences,0,"Utility-implemented load-shedding aims to balance the supply and demand of a constrained power grid for a scheduled period of time by switching off supply to selected regions. The unintended consequence of this strategy occurs at the return of supply, where an instantaneous peak demand is experienced as an impulse at localised points of the power system. This results in frequent trips on medium voltage breakers that can damage infrastructure and result in delayed return of supply to end-users. The aim of this paper is to examine demand-side management interventions using intelligent control of electric water heaters (EWHs) to reduce the instantaneous peak demand at return of supply. Domestic water heating load was chosen as it is a deferrable, dispatchable, passive load with a high power requirement. The approach taken simulates the loading effect of 3 600 EWHs using three measured tank states and the combination of the Monte Carlo algorithm for probabilistic population behaviour. A typical 150-litre, 3 kW EWH in horizontal orientation is used, with a maximum draw volume of 50-litre per tank per day. It is shown that system changes to load-shedding schedules from a period of 4.5-hours to 2.5-hours beneficially reduces the instantaneous peak demand with the shorter period. For a 3 600 EWH-population, simulated results comparing uniformly distributed stochastic delays for activation time windows within 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes show that a 15-minute activation time window could reduce the expected peak demand by a factor of two. This is important because intelligent controller retrofits onto EWHs is becoming more ubiquitous and if this simple sub-routine is built-in to produce a short delay after a period of no supply, it could result in significant passive impact on the power grid.",Load-shedding;domestic sector;electric water heater;ripple control;stochastic delays;demand-side management;load aggregation;Monte Carlo algorithm,,"Electrical & Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Electrical & Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Electrical & Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"

Müller,2023,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"Recently, many reactive trajectory planning approaches were suggested in the literature because of their inherent immediate adaption in the ever more demanding cluttered and unpredictable environments of robotic systems. However, typically those approaches are only locally reactive without considering global path planning and no guarantees for simultaneous collision avoidance and goal convergence can be given. In this paper, we study a recently developed circular field (CF)-based motion planner [1] that combines local reactive control with global trajectory generation by adapting an artificial magnetic field such that multiple trajectories around obstacles can be evaluated. In particular, we provide a mathematically rigorous analysis of this planner for static environments in the horizontal plane to ensure safe motion of the controlled robot. Contrary to existing results, the derived collision avoidance analysis covers the entire CF motion planning algorithm including attractive forces for goal convergence and is not limited to a specific choice of the rotation field, i.e., our guarantees are not limited to a specific potentially suboptimal trajectory. Our Lyapunov-type collision avoidance analysis is based on the definition of an (equivalent) twodimensional auxiliary system, which enables us to provide tight, if and only if conditions for the case of a collision with point obstacles. Furthermore, we show how this analysis naturally extends to multiple obstacles and we specify sufficient conditions for goal convergence.

1157,Assembly-Oriented Finite-Time Coordinated Control of Underactuated Dual Rotary Cranes for Payload Position and Attitude Regulation,Z. Liu; N. Sun; T. Yang; G. Liu; Y. Fang,2023,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"With strong load capacity and high maneuverability of payload attitude regulation, dual rotary cranes (DRCs) are widely applied for transportation and assembly tasks in infrastructure construction. For DRCs, to achieve safe and accurate control of the payload position and attitude, it is necessary to enhance the motion synchronization of two cranes, under the premise of controlling more state variables with fewer control inputs based on nonlinear coupling dynamics; moreover, the finite-time convergence of positioning errors is also expected to be guaranteed for high efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes an assembly-oriented finite-time coordinated controller without any linearization to the nonlinear crane dynamics, which realizes accurate and stable regulation of the payload position and attitude through coordinated boom motions. To our knowledge, the proposed controller provides the first closed-loop control solution to realize both horizontal and non-horizontal payload hoisting for DRCs based on practical assembly demands. Theoretically, through elaborate design of the synchronization error and coupling errors, the real-time information exchange between the two cranes is realized for the first time, which enhances the boom motion synchronization while suppressing payload swings. Furthermore, by introducing continuous terminal sliding mode surfaces with a multi-layer nested structure, the finite-time convergence of the boom positioning errors and the synchronization error is ensured with chattering reduction. Additionally, rigorous closed-loop stability analysis is provided based on Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat’s Lemma. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller are verified by hardware experimental results. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the coordinated motion control problem of dual rotary cranes (DRCs), which aims to achieve safe and accurate control of the payload position and attitude oriented on practical assembly demands. At present, most control methods for DRCs only realize horizontal payload transportation, which not only ignores the requirements of payload attitude regulation in assembly tasks, but also lacks the guarantee for boom motion coordination and the finite-time convergence of state variables. To address these issues, based on the nonlinear crane dynamics without any linearization, this paper proposes an assembly-oriented finite-time coordinated controller for DRCs, which achieves precise and stable regulation of the payload position and attitude through coordinated boom motions, and simultaneously enhances the system rapidity by ensuring the finite-time convergence of boom positioning errors. Furthermore, the detailed controller design and stability analysis process is provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by hardware experiments.

However, these methods require all training samples to be annotated by rotated boxes. Compared with the traditional horizontal box, annotating with such a directional box is a laborious and time-consuming work. To solve this problem, we propose a novel partially supervised ship detection method by attaching an extra rbox (rotated bounding box) regression branch as well as a weight conversion function to the typical object detection network. The parameters of predicting horizontal bounding boxes in typical object detection network can be converted into those for rotated bounding box regression through the weight conversion function.

This innovative use of MRI devices allows exerting magnetic pulling forces on untethered magnetic robots, which could be used for navigation, diagnosis, drug delivery and therapeutic procedures inside a human body. So far, MRI-powered untethered magnetic robots lack simultaneous position and orientation control inside three-dimensional (3D) fluids, and therefore, their control has been limited to 3-DoF position control. In this paper, we present a path-planning-based 5-DoF control algorithm to steer and control an MRI-powered untethered robot's position and orientation simultaneously in 3D workspaces in fluids. Eventhough the simulation results show that the proposed optimal controller can successfully control the robot for 5-DoF, in the experiments, we observe a reduced 5-DoF controllability due to the robot manufacturing errors, which result in pitch angle to remain at around the neutral pitching angle at the steady state. The proposed controller was evaluated to track four different paths (linear, planar-horizontal, planar-vertical and 3D paths) generated by 3D Bezier curves. The worst-case path-tracking error was observed for 3D path-following experiments. For this case, the position-tracking error was 2.7±1.8 mm, and the orientation-tracking error was 13.5± 28.7 and 3.7± 10.2 degrees for yaw and pitch angles, respectively. The overall path is completed within 19.6 seconds with 23.6 mm overall displacement and 61.2 and 41.2 degrees of yaw and pitch angle rotation, respectively.

Manoonpong,2023,2023 IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft),IEEE Conferences,0,"Soft-bodied crawling animals (like caterpillars and inchworms) exploit their active soft bodies with passive adapt-ability to achieve efficient locomotion and move on multiple terrains. While several research studies have used this principle for robot development, most existing caterpillar/inchworm-inspired soft robots can still crawl on specific terrain (flat, inner, or outer pipes). To advance state-of-the-art soft robotic technology, we propose here a small soft-bodied crawling robot with electromagnetic legs and passive body adaptation. The robot is driven by neural central pattern generator (CPG)-based control. Due to the combination of its actively con-tractable/extendable body, passively adaptable interconnected body joints, and electromagnetic legs, the robot can successfully crawl on a variety of metal terrains, including a flat surface, step, slope, confined space, and an inner (concave surface) and outer (convex surface) pipe in both horizontal and vertical directions. Additionally, it can be steered to navigate through a cluttered environment with obstacles. Using the CPG-based control method, the robot's locomotion speed can be simply regulated by changing a single CPG-frequency control param-eter.

Subsequently, a tilt-torsion decomposition-based attitude controller is developed to prioritize the correction of horizontal posture over yaw error. The attitude error is separated into roll-pitch portion and yaw portion.

1177,The Apollonian paradigm in Cockpit and Ground-based Pilot Display Design,N. L. Fulton; G. S. Garden; B. P. Williams; E. Theunissen,2019,2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),IEEE Conferences,2,"The design of aircraft Detect and Avoid (DAA) systems is critical to enabling Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) greater access to nonsegregated airspace and has the potential to enhance the safety of conventionally piloted aircraft operations. Existing approaches to the “avoid” component of DAA use a sampling approach to determine the range of trajectories (based on a hazard zone) that must be avoided. In at least one existing DAA display, to inform the pilot about the location of the hazard zone the space where DAA Well Clear (DWC) is predicted to be lost is depicted. The abstractness of such a visualization may make it difficult to reconstitute operational reasoning behind the rendering and means the validation of the depicted heading guidance and hazard zone is limited to the cases simulated. Geometric models are part of the suite of fundamental mathematical analyses required to specify cue design and presentation for cockpit displays. In a complementary approach to simulation methods the Apollonian Circles have been shown to have a direct application to the design of DAA systems with the potential to enhance, through this geometric construction, the specification, robustness, and safety of all proximate aircraft operations. The property that, for a constant speed ratio, the locus of all collision points lie on the Apollonius Circle in the 2D conflict plane, has been used to explore an augmentation concept for DAA cockpit displays that are based on conflict probing. The conflict probe underlying the horizontal guidance is derived from all spatial locations where ownship (ownaircraft) is predicted to lose DWC as defined in RTCA DO-365. Color-coded heading bands indicate whether the time until the DWC boundary is crossed has decreased below the Corrective (yellow) or Warning (red) threshold. Should the intruder be maneuvering at the time of a DAA Warning Alert, uncertainty regarding intruder intent may require a pilot to reverse the direction of a horizontal maneuver that was initiated at the moment the Warning Alert was declared. The underlying cause is that the heading guidance bands answer the question “What if ownship were flying in this direction?” assuming the reported intruder track is maintained and that neither intent nor turn-rate is available. To be able to anticipate the result of an intruder maneuver, an obvious follow-on question is “How do the heading guidance bands change as a function of a changing intruder track?”. Whereas with the conflict probe display the possible point of collision (PPC) results from ownship tracks tested against the reported intruder track, the Apollonius Circle allows the PPCs for other intruder directions and the associated ownship track to be analytically determined. In this paper we also extend the Apollonius Circle paradigm to include the Apollonian Circles being a geometric construction comprised of two families (pencils) of coaxal circles each with collinear centers and each with a radical axis. The first family is comprised of Apollonius Circles whose construction is based on a segment. These are Hyperbolic in nature and nested such that there is no intersection between the circles. The second family, the X-Track circles, is Elliptic in nature and each circle in the family intersects the other circles in two specific points being the locations of the aircraft in the proximity pair. A distinguished member of the X-Track circles is the Line of Sight Circle that enables the behaviour of the relative velocity vector and the miss distance vector at closest approach to be readily visualized. The Apollonian Circles provide a rigorous closed-form framework enabling more transparent construction and validation of complex Well Clear Volume surfaces. They lend themselves directly to cue design, the establishment of a more complete and rigorous test regime, and can aid crew and operators to make more informed decisions regarding proximity and conflict resolution. This geometric method is analytic thus results can be calculated in real-time, and provides a more complete and accurate advisory generation capability specific to the imposed encounter condition. Flight crew and ground-based remote pilots are better aided to identify available actions, decide on satisficing actions, nominate an avoidance manoeuver, and physically execute it; all in a safe, defendable, and timely manner.",Apollonius Circle;Bipolar Co-ordinates;Conflict Detection,,"School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Boeing Research & Technology, Australia; Boeing Research & Technology, Australia; Netherlands Defence Academy"

Chen,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,1,"A novel trajectory-shaping guidance law with impact angle constraint is proposed for attacking stationary targets in a three-dimensional environment. The guidance concept, derived from the inverse dynamic method, is to design an analytical curve trajectory satisfying the impact angle in advance and obtain reasonable control commands. The vehicle motion is decomposed in the horizontal and vertical planes of the inertial coordinate system. Firstly, the trajectory in the vertical plane is designed as ellipse, which can be shaped by adjusting its axis direction. An improved sliding mode control (SMC) method, which adds position-dependent correction to the weight in sliding mode surface, is adopted to track the nominal trajectory. Therefore, the vehicle approaches the ellipse quickly and smoothly in the early stage and hits the stationary target accurately. Secondly, a third-order Bézier curve with adjustable parameters is employed as the prior nominal trajectory in the lateral plane. When the vehicle deviates from the original trajectory due to perturbation or self-limitation, it will turn to the updated curve in real time according to its own condition. Moreover, coupling of acceleration commands in the two planes is resolved through acceleration decomposition, which qualifies independent trajectory design in two planes and paves a new way to more curve combinations. Nominal testing and Monte Carlo simulations on the proposed method are carried out. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed guidance law is highly designable and strongly robust.",Hypersonic vehicle;geometric guidance;elliptic guidance;descent guidance,,"School of Astronautics, Beihang university, Beijing, China; School of Astronautics, Beihang university, Beijing, China; School of Astronautics, Beihang university, Beijing, China; School of Astronautics, Beihang university, Beijing, China"

Cruz,2019,2019 IEEE Underwater Technology (UT),IEEE Conferences,0,"The maximum mission duration and range of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle are governed by the amount of energy carried on board and the way it is spent during the mission. While an increase in battery capacity and a decrease in electronics demand yield a direct increase in vehicle range, the impact of velocity variation is not so obvious. With slower velocities, most of the energy will be spent in electronics, not in motion, while for faster velocities a lot of energy will be needed to balance drag. Flying-type AUVs have a minimum velocity for the control surfaces to be effective, reducing the range of values for optimization. Hovering type AUVs, on the other hand, are typically slower moving platforms, able to travel at arbitrarily slow velocities.

Zweigel,2021,2021 European Control Conference (ECC),IEEE Conferences,3,"Navigation systems, estimating the vehicle states with high accuracy, robustness and integrity, are crucial for guidance system in autonomous applications. This publication presents a filter-bank approach designed for a tightly-coupled navigation system, aiming at improving the integrity of the navigation system and the accuracy of the estimated navigation solution under sensor failures. In particular, this navigation system is based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is aided by pseudorange and deltarange-observation of satellite systems, and 3D velocity measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL). The designed filter-bank approach proposes a new structure, which handles the challenge of different update rates and measurement delays of the involved sensors. Under IMU failures, the estimated states from the filter bank are reversed to estimate the vehicle acceleration, which improves the IMU bias and state estimation performance at next epochs. The designed approach is validated in a real-time test campaign with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in the harbor of Rostock, Germany. During the real-time test, several forms of simulative faults are added to the DVL measurements to evaluate the designed approach. Meanwhile, all necessary sensor data is recorded for further evaluation in post-processing environment. The experimental results show that the designed approach is capable of identifying the simulated sensor failures. Compared with conventional tightly-coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF), the designed approach improves the average horizontal positioning accuracy and its standard deviation under simulative DVL failures by 167% and 771%, respectively.",,,"Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Germany; Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Germany; Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Germany; Institute of Automatic Control, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"

Matsunaga; S. Oka,2023,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,1,"Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been attracting attention as a solution to coverage hole problems in millimeter-wave communication areas. They are considered to be one of the key technologies of next-generation mobile communication systems. Since polarized multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is utilized in millimeter-wave communication systems to deliver high-speed data transmission, an IRS is also required to be applied for polarized MIMO and reflect signals in a wide angle range. To realize an IRS for the polarized MIMO, the IRS is required to reflect the signal of each polarization in the same direction with high isolation. In addition, the IRS is required to control the reflection phase over a wide range. In recent research, many proposals related to the development of IRSs have been proposed. However, since the configuration of a conventional IRS with diodes controls the reflection characteristics by controlling the electric length or shape of the reflecting element, it becomes asymmetrical in the direction of each polarization and it is difficult to apply polarized MIMO. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new design of a dual-polarized liquid-crystal-based IRS for 28 GHz mobile communication systems. Since the proposed IRS controls the reflecting phase by controlling the electric thickness of the substrate, the IRS can control the reflecting phase without changing the shape of the reflecting element. By optimizing the design of the reflecting element, the IRS can achieve a wide reflection phase control of 260 degrees for both vertical and horizontal polarizations. The IRS can also control the reflection direction of each polarization in the range of ±60 degrees with a high isolation of more than 20 dB. The main contributions of this paper are 1) a proposal for the design of a liquid crystal IRS for polarized MIMO; 2) a proposal of a design method for the liquid-crystal IRS using unit cell analysis; 3) verification of the proposed IRS through electromagnetic field analysis; 4) development of the proposed liquid-crystal IRS; 5) experimental verification of the proposed IRS in an anechoic chamber, and 6) derivation of the MIMO channel capacity of the proposed dual-polarized IRS.",Beyond 5G/6G;coverage hole;intelligent reflecting surface;liquid crystal;millimeter wave;polarized MIMO;channel capacity,,"KDDI Research Inc., Saitama, Fujimino-shi, Japan; KDDI Research Inc., Saitama, Fujimino-shi, Japan; KDDI Research Inc., Saitama, Fujimino-shi, Japan; KDDI Research Inc., Saitama, Fujimino-shi, Japan; Japan Display Inc., Kawakita-machi, Nomi-gun, Japan; Japan Display Inc., Kawakita-machi, Nomi-gun, Japan; Japan Display Inc., Kawakita-machi, Nomi-gun, Japan; Japan Display Inc., Mobara-shi, Japan"

The patch was then loaded by small solid piece of demetalized low-loss substrate of two different relative permittivities to examine the load presence influence on the radiated immunity. The wave impedance was used as the criterion. Results show that, in both cases, the load presence lowers the wave impedance, disregarding the PCB orientation with respect to the antenna in scenario (2). Moreover, no improvements due to the variation of the load permittivity value were observed in the E / H ratio distribution in a TEM cell similar to those obtained with the PCB oriented perpendicularly to the antenna in a real far-field zone.

The antenna consists of two groups of radiation patches, in 7 layers, and uses the orthogonal adjacent coupling structure on staggered layer to excite a pair of linear polarization modes. Thanks to the staggered feeder mode, it has increased the isolation performance between ports and compressed the transverse size of the antenna. As a result of the combination of staggered stack-up between the patches and the stepped gradient shape of the main radiating patches, it has effectively expanded the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. The proposed antenna is simulated, fabricated and measured. The staggered feeding structure effectively reduces the cross-sectional area of the antenna, and greatly improves the isolation between feeding ports. The measurement results show that the impedance bandwidths for vertical and horizontal polarization modes are 40.2% (638–960 MHz) and 40.0% (645968 MHz) respectively when the return loss is lower than −10 dB, and the isolation between feeding ports is better than −30 dB.

Niu,2021,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,IEEE Journals,36,"The co-design problem of 2-D event generators and sliding mode controller (SMC) is studied in this article for the discrete-time 2-D Roesser model to reduce the communication usage between the plant and the controller. First, by resorting to the 2-D reaching law conditions, the event-based 2-D SMC schemes are proposed and a kind of horizonal/vertical independent event generator is designed. Then, the stability of the sliding-mode dynamics is analyzed and a nonlinear matrix inequality condition associated with the horizontal/vertical sliding matrices is obtained. In order to solve the derived nonlinear matrix inequality condition without introducing conservatism, a binary genetic algorithm (GA) is applied by considering a multiobjective optimization problem, which reflects the tradeoff between the convergence of the sliding-mode dynamics and the scheduling performance of the designed horizontal/vertical event generators. Finally, a simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-design approach with GA.",2-D systems;event-triggering protocol;genetic algorithm (GA);Roesser model;sliding mode control,,"Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"

To obtain the tripartite balance of spectrum efficiency, system throughput and complexity at the receiving end, clustered-NOMA (C-NOMA) is recommended. With Low Altitude Platform Station (LAPS) like UAV for strengthening communication in certain areas, and High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) for ensuring wide coverage, we put forward the XAPS-enabled (including one HAPS and multiple UAVs) C-NOMA system in 6G heterogeneous Internet of things and investigate the joint 3D-location planning and resource allocation problem by optimizing four factors systematically, which are the spectrum allocation, power control, horizontal coordinate and hovering altitude optimization of UAVs to maximize the overall system uplink achievable sum rate. Due to the strong coupling among these factors, it is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is extremely difficult to solve. Therefore, we decompose it and propose a two-stage solution. Specifically, in the first stage we transfer resource allocation problem into a many-to-one spectrum matching game coupled with power control, where UAVs and subchannels are two groups of participants. Then we complete the second stage by optimizing UAVs’ 3D-locations, including horizontal coordinates and hovering altitudes. Finally, we repeat these two stages iteratively until the near-optimal result is obtained. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show that our proposed approach outperforms previous solutions in terms of system uplink sum rate with relatively low complexity.",XAPS-enabled C-NOMA;many-to-one matching;3D-location planning;resource allocation;6G heterogeneous IoT,,"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Institute of Space-Based Information Systems, China Academy of Electronic and Information Technology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"

Bian,2022,IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine,IEEE Magazines,3,"A water-based, switchable frequency-selective rasorber (FSR) with polarization selectivity using Great Wall structures is presented in this article. The proposed structure includes a container comprising horizontal and vertical channels enabling a dividable injection of water and a cross-gap frequency-selective surface (FSS). The novelty of the design lies in its switchability among three different operating states by injecting water into different water channels. When the horizontal channel is filled with water and there is no water in the vertical channel, this structure can be used as an FSR with single-polarization selectivity. The FSR with a −10-dB absorption band from 6.8 to 18.8 GHz allows only certain polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves to pass at 3.1 GHz with an insertion loss of −0.78 dB, while another polarized EM wave cannot pass. When the two channels are filled with water, the structure acts as an absorber in high frequency in which any polarized EM wave cannot be transmitted. Furthermore, the original transmission frequency band in low frequency is switched to the reflection frequency band. Besides, a reconfigurable, water-based FSR automatic control system is built to achieve state switching and temperature constancy of the water within the container. Ultimately, a prototype of the presented design is fabricated, simulated, and measured to verify feasibility.

However, the in-band ripples in filters resulting from the spurious Rayleigh mode lead to deteriorated performance, and thus, a wide Rayleigh elimination window (REW) is highly desired for realizing spurious-free wideband surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters with a wide design space and good process tolerance. Here, we investigated the spurious mode suppression on the LN/SiO2/Si platform theoretically and experimentally through modulating the cut angle ( $\theta $ ) of LN. The  ${K}^{{2}}$  dispersion characteristics of the main mode (shear-horizontal wave) and spurious mode (Rayleigh wave) on LN/SiO2/Si substrates were systematically analyzed by the finite-element method (FEM), along with bulk LN for comparison. It is found that the REW is wider on LN/SiO2/Si than bulk LN, as Rayleigh wave can be totally eliminated with Cu electrode normalized thickness ( ${h}_{\text {Cu}}/\lambda $ ) ranging from 0.1 to 0.19 when  $\theta $  is between 19° and 22° on the LN/SiO2/Si platform, in contrast to the quite narrow REW on bulk LN restricted to some specific  ${h}_{\text {Cu}}/\lambda$ . To verify the simulation results, resonators were prepared on 15°YX-LN/SiO2/Si, 20°YX-LN/SiO2/Si, bulk 15°YX-LN, and bulk 20°YX-LN.

To ensure a specific service level requested by the cloud-based applications, there is a need for an approach to assign adequate resources to each VM. To this end, we present our novel Multi-Loop Control approach, called MultiScaler, to allocate resources to VMs based on the Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements and the run-time conditions. MultiScaler is mainly composed of three different levels working closely with each other to achieve an optimal resource allocation. We propose a set of tailor-made controllers to monitor VMs and take actions accordingly to regulate contention among collocated VMs, to reallocate resources if required, and to migrate VMs from one PM to another.

The filter with a center frequency of 3.26 GHz features a suppressed spurious passband, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 3%, and a minimum insertion loss (IL) of 2.39 dB. In addition, coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and SH-SAW resonators built on LTOS and LiTaO3-on-insulator (LTOI) substrates were compared over a temperature range of 25 °C–150 °C. Due to the extremely high resistivity of the sapphire and the excellent thermal stability of the LiTaO3/sapphire interface, the IL of the CPW and the impedance ratio (in addition to Bode-Q) of the SH-SAW on the LTOS are maintained well even at 150 °C, while those on the LTOI seriously deteriorate. Of these, the impedance attenuation of LTOS-SAW at the antiresonant frequency is only 3.7 dB at 150 °C, whereas that of LTOI-SAW reaches 9.6 dB, demonstrating excellent temperature stability of the LTOS substrate’s radio frequency (RF) performance.

Assistive robots for ADLs are developed to perform tasks that the disabled person would require frequent need for a caregiver. These assistive robotic systems are either manually controlled or controlled via a shared control scheme, thus are not fully autonomous. This paper proposes an autonomous assistive robotic system to perform drinking task for disabled people. The system employs a UR-10 6-DOF manipulator to convey a cup of drink to the user’s mouth and perform autonomously the drinking task in a nature manner. A Kinect sensor is used for online face and mouth detection and head pose tracking, recognition of the cup region of interest and the drink level. The robot trajectory planning and control are done such that the cup is kept upright and is conveyed at a constant speed to the user’s detected mouth point. This makes use of the 3D data acquired from image processing and is online updated for trajectory replanning when the head and mouth pose unintentionally change. Also, during drinking, the cup is continuously reoriented to keep the horizontal drink level at the mouth point and to ensure that the cup remains in contact with the user’s mouth.

Alasty,2021,2021 9th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM),IEEE Conferences,0,"In recent decades, unmanned aerial vehicles, especially quadrotors due to high agility, have become the research focus for many applications. However, fast descending is one of the limitations in these vehicles due to an aerodynamic effect which is a region in velocity space known as Vortex Ring State (VRS); a region in the velocity space where the blade lift is noticeably different from normal regions, and there are often large amplitude fluctuations that may lead to instability. One way to avoid entering this region is to increase the horizontal speed in the blade disk frame. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel over-actuated quadrotor with variable dihedral angles to achieve horizontal velocity in the blade disk without any horizontal displacement by changing the angle of the rotors. This design is presented with special considerations in changing the rotor angle and its effect on the thrust required for rotors at hover and other maneuvers in dihedral mode. Outdoor flight experiments show that the designed quadrotor in normal and fixed dihedral can perform missions well and achieve acceptable stability when a normal crosswind is present.Moreover, the designed variable dihedral mechanism has an insignificant vibration level in the real tests and achieves stable performance when a maximum thrust is loaded on a rotor mounted on one of the arms. Also, the rotor angle in this mechanism was changed continuously in all applied thrusts with the least vibration and prevented the rotor's change of direction at a certain angle.

Solar irradiance is the most important factor affecting PV power. Accurately estimating the amount of solar irradiance leads to better production estimates from solar panels. Meanwhile, satellite images provide information on current and future cloud coverage, and are potentially useful in inferring solar irradiance. To accurately capture the effect of cloud on irradiance, this article develops a real-time mapping model between satellite image and solar irradiance. Based on the mapping model, a new ultrashort-term global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasting method combining satellite visible images and meteorological information is proposed. First, a modified method is utilized for reducing the influence of the solar zenith angle on pixel intensity and extracting the features in the image processing stage. Then, the cloud cover factors are extracted from satellite visible images by using the modified convolutional neural network.

However, it remains a challenge for the robot to avoid collisions with all obstacles in the environment. Since LRF can only scan a horizontal slice of the world, some objects cannot be fully observed, such as tables and chairs. In this article, an effective solution based on laser-visual fusion is presented to enhance the safety of the robot. First, a vision sensor is adopted to help detect obstacles that are not fully visible to LRF. Then we propose a method to convert the depth information of the visual image into 2-D pseudo-laser data representation. With this representation, a strategy for 2-D mapping is developed. On this basis, a novel map fusion algorithm is proposed to generate an improved grid map that amends the incorrect representation of obstacles on the traditional 2-D grid map. We further investigate a robot autonomous navigation strategy that considers LRF data and pseudo-laser data to avoid all obstacles. Experimental results show that the improved grid map together with the presented navigation strategy allows the robot not only to plan a “real” collision-free path, but also to navigate safely in both static and dynamic scenarios, and the proposed strategies can significantly enhance the performance of robot navigation in terms of safety, reliability and robustness.",Laser-visual fusion;mapping;mobile robot;navigation;safety strategy;spatial obstacle,,"School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China; School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"

Wang,2022,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,5,"Omnidirectional three-dimensional (3D) measurement based on the binocular omnidirectional vision system attracts increasing attention in computer vision. A 360° horizontal field of view (FOV) and 180° vertical FOV are obtained by the binocular omnidirectional vision system with only a pair of images. However, a nonlinear relationship exists between points on image planes and in 3D space for the binocular omnidirectional vision system, and traditional calibration methods are no longer applicable. This study proposes a hybrid calibration approach, which effectively fuses the unified camera model and the backpropagation neural network with a virtual 3D target, in which the neural network improved with genetic algorithm compensates all kinds of distortions and errors. First, the unified camera model is used to calibrate the intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and a transformation matrix. Second, the pixel coordinates on image planes are converted to 3D coordinates by 3D reconstruction through binocular vision. The errors between actual and calculated 3D coordinates are obtained. In addition, the neural network improved with genetic algorithm is established and trained with pixel coordinates on image planes and errors. Experimental results indicate that the average measurement errors in the X and Y directions of the central area are respectively reduced to 0.1057 and 0.1548 mm, and those of the edge area are reduced to 0.1992 and 0.2748 mm.

A 55 MHz antenna will be secured onto the wings. The UAS, called Astrid, is designed based on previous research experience that provided information on the significant effects of the polar atmospheric conditions (e.g. wind shear, gusts, etc.) on UAS performance. In addition to the adverse weather conditions, post flight test analysis showed that pusher engines on UASs cause significant changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments generated by the horizontal tail. This is primarily due to the turbulent nature of the propwash slipstreams flowing over the empennage and variation of their turbulency with changes in engine RPM. Based on this information, a wing configuration with a stabilizing polyhedral is selected. Astrid UAS also features a pusher engine with a twin boom, high-horizontal tail offset from the zero-lift plane.

When no current is biased, the device has two resonant absorption dips locating at 0.55 and 1.0 THz, respectively. And the transmission of transparent band between two resonant absorption dips can be electrically modulated by the bias current. When the bias current increases to 0.3 A, the maximum modulation depth at 0.8 THz reaches 99%. This electrically tunability is resulted from the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) of the embedded VO2 film. Most interestingly, a huge hysteresis is observed, which is important for developing electrically controlled THz binary coders.

The ECE evaluation results of enterprises need to be displayed to non-professionals such as consumers. Therefore, in addition to being able to characterize the ECE level, the ECE evaluation results of enterprise should be intuitive and easy to understand. For this purpose, the ECE-codes are designed, including the horizontal identification code (HIC), the efficiency identification code (EIC), and the neutralization identification code (NIC). Define carbon emission intensity (CEI) as the ECEs required to produce an unit of profit. The HIC is formed by dividing the CEI of enterprises into three levels, and is used to grade an enterprise's carbon emission level in the entire industrial sector. The EIC is formed through five-level evaluation of CEI in sector (CEIS), which is used to measure the CEI level of an enterprise in its sector. The CEIS is the ratio of CEI to the average value of the sector CEI. NIC is used to display an enterprise's carbon neutrality process, which is the ratio of carbon neutrality to total carbon emissions. To achieve effective grading of CEI and CEIS, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is established to describe the distribution of the CEI and CEIS, and the model parameters are identified by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

Among these, oriented object detection has emerged as a promising approach for detecting and localizing objects in images with arbitrary orientations. While traditional object detection methods rely on horizontal bounding boxes so that it is difficult for detecting oriented objects, oriented object detection leverages the rich representation power of deep neural networks to learn object-oriented features that capture both the appearance and orientation of objects in images. This paper introduces an orientation-aware neural network detector called Directional R-CNN with sample augmentation. The proposed framework addresses the issue of over-fitting by using various data augmentation techniques to improve the quality and quantity of the image samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is extensively evaluated through experiments conducted on real-world logistics applications, specifically for detecting oriented objects.

Hang,2021,2021 OES China Ocean Acoustics (COA),IEEE Conferences,0,"The complex underwater noise field is formed in the process of the ship's constant volume sound source sailing. Due to the large number of machinery and equipment on the ship, and the navigation state of the ship on the sea is easy to change, these factors make it difficult to obtain the low-frequency radiated noise characteristics of the ship in a stable state. Therefore, it is an effective way to understand and master the characteristics of low-frequency underwater radiated noise field by using directional sound source in controllable state. Dipole transducer is a typical directional sound source with horizontal or vertical octagonal directivity, which is widely used in seismic and logging research. However, few dipole transducers are used in underwater acoustic research. The reason is: the directional emission of underwater acoustic low-frequency transducer is a big problem in the current transducer design. The directional emission technology of low-frequency dipole transducer is related to the distance / wavelength of the radiation surface. Because the position relationship of the radiation surface is fixed, it can only form the ideal directivity at a specific frequency. This brings great inconvenience to the application of underwater acoustic low- frequency dipole transducer. Firstly, the mathematical model of sound field radiated by acoustic dipole is established; then, the common non-directional low-frequency sound source is used to construct an acoustic dipole source. By adjusting the distance between two low-frequency sound sources, low-frequency dipole signals with different frequencies can be emitted. The lake test results show that the maximum difference of horizontal directivity of dipole source is less than 0.5dB and the depth of concave point is more than 21dB; finally, the test scheme in shallow water is designed, and the low-frequency narrow-band signals of 63Hz and 80Hz are emitted by the acoustic dipole source in uniform towing state, and the received signals of the bottom mounted hydrophone are analyzed and processed. The results of marine test show that the horizontal directivity of the dipole sound source constructed by two low-frequency sound sources can meet the requirements of acoustic test at multiple frequencies. The dipole transducer constructed in this paper has the advantages of simple structure, convenient equipment connection and wide signal frequency band, which can be applied in the study of underwater acoustic field characteristics of ships. Using the dipole sound source constructed in this paper, the sound propagation characteristics of underwater directional sound sources such as ships in the far field can be studied.",Directional sound source;acoustic dipole;dipole source construction;shallow water test,,"Science and Technology on Underwater Test and Control Laboratory, DaLian, China; Dalian Scientific Test and Control Technology Insititute, DaLian, China; Dalian Scientific Test and Control Technology Insititute, DaLian, China; Science and Technology on Underwater Test and Control Laboratory, DaLian, China; Science and Technology on Underwater Test and Control Laboratory, DaLian, China"

The CFD software Fluent is adopted to simulate a wind farm with two tandem wind turbines with TEFs at rated and below rated turbulent wind conditions. Under the 11.4 m/s turbulent wind conditions, the results show that the deflection of the TEF increases the velocity deficit and reduces the wake width, making the wake more complicated.

1254,Vertical COM Motion Generation to Reduce Slipping and Mechanical Work during Walking,S. Park; J. Park,2019,2019 IEEE-RAS 19th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids),IEEE Conferences,0,"A robot foot can slip when the horizontal shear force acting on the foot exceeds the frictional force between the foot and the ground. In the linear inverted-pendulum (LIP) model, the vertical height of the center of mass (COM) is kept constant, and the vertical force is always equal to the gravitational force at any walking speed. However, the horizontal force increases upon increasing the walking speed. This restriction on the vertical force in the LIP model can cause the robot foot to slip at fast walking speeds, as the horizontal force can exceed the frictional force, which is proportional to the vertical force. In this study, we present an optimization method to generate vertical COM motion to maintain the utilized coefficient of friction (uCOF) less than the available coefficient of friction between the foot and the ground, and to minimize the mechanical work of the COM. Vertical motions at various speeds are generated using the proposed optimization method. Subsequently, the generated COM motion patterns are used as reference trajectories of the COM in robot simulation. Optimization and simulation results demonstrate that the mechanical work and uCOF decrease because of the vertical motion. This study suggests a way to generate slip-safe and energy-efficient COM patterns, which, in turn, overcome the limitations of the LIP model by adding vertical COM motion.",,,"Department of Transdisciplinary Studies, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Digital Human Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Suwon, Republic of Korea"

In this paper, we investigate transfer learning for HGV trajectory prediction to evaluate how stochastic grammars trained on a limited number of HGV trajectories perform on new, unseen HGV trajectories. Our analysis includes two datasets containing HGV trajectories that exhibit different maneuvers. One dataset contains trajectories that exhibit vertical maneuvers, which are behaviors related to changes in altitude. The second dataset exhibits both horizontal and vertical maneuvers, where horizontal maneuvers refer to changes in crossrange and downrange. The vertical dataset is also significantly smaller than the second dataset (i.e., the dataset that exhibits horizontal and vertical maneuvers). We develop a prediction method using the smaller, less complicated dataset to model HGV trajectories. Specifically, we use an unsupervised machine learning method based on stochastic grammars.

So far, several approaches toward balancing of the modular multilevel converter internal energy, in both vertical and horizontal directions, have been proposed. Nevertheless, differences among them have never been analytically supported. In this article, three seemingly different energy balancing strategies are thoroughly explained, providing a framework for the theoretical comparison of different dynamic responses provided by them. All the results are verified on the large-scale hardware-in-the-loop platform, serving as a digital twin of a grid-connected 3.3-kVac/5-kVdc 1.25-MW converter being driven by the industrial ABB PEC800 controller.",Chainlink converters;energy balancing;energy control;modular multilevel converter (MMC),,"Power Electronics Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Power Electronics Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"

This study proposes a compass model with a wobbling mass connected to the upper body and oscillating in the horizontal direction to clarify the influence of the horizontal dynamics of the upper body on bipedal walking. The limit cycles of the model were numerically searched, and their stability and energy efficiency was investigated. Several qualitatively different limit cycles were obtained depending mainly on the spring constant that supports the wobbling mass. Specific types of solutions decreased the stability while reducing the risk of accidental falling and improving the energy efficiency. The obtained results were attributed to the wobbling mass moving in the opposite direction to the upper body, thereby preventing large changes in acceleration and deceleration while walking.

However, the DEM adjustment method based on the function model can only correct systematic elevation error, affecting the plane accuracy of DEM mosaic products. Given this issue, this article proposes a 3-D InSAR-DEM block adjustment method based on general models with a separate adjustment strategy, that is, first correct vertical error using the adjustment method based on the function model and then correct horizontal error using the method based on rational function model after compensating for elevation errors. In order to extract the tie points (TPs) and ground control points (GCPs) used in adjustment, we propose a normalized correlation coefficient matching method based on complex slope maps (NCC-CSM). We conduct experiments using 29 TanDEM-X coregistered single look slant range complex data. The accuracies of adjustment results are verified using ICESat-2 ATL08 data and selected GCPs, respectively. The adjustment experiments show that the elevation accuracy of InSAR-DEM is improved from 1.70 to 1.35 m, the absolute and relative plane accuracies are improved by 5.58 and 11.53 m, respectively, and the horizontal and vertical geometric discontinuity in the overlapping area disappear.

We exploit the UAV’s mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space to improve its cognitive communication performance while controlling the co-channel interference at the primary receivers (PRs), such that the received interference power at each PR is below a prescribed threshold termed as interference temperature (IT). First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is placed at a static location during each communication period of interest. In this case, we jointly optimize the UAV’s 3D placement and power control to maximize the SR’s achievable rate, subject to the UAV’s altitude and transmit power constraints, as well as a set of IT constraints at the PRs to protect their communications. Second, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, in which the UAV is dispatched to fly from an initial location to a final location within a given task period. We propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the SR’s average achievable rate over this period by jointly optimizing the UAV’s 3D trajectory and power control, subject to the additional constraints on UAV’s maximum flying speed and initial/final locations. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs for different scenarios, as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Lata; R. Mangsatabam,2021,2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100),IEEE Conferences,2,"The rise of new aircraft propulsion methods, the increased use of automated and integrated flight control systems, and the envisioned use of personal Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles in urban environments leads to novel technical and regulatory challenges for aircraft manufacturers, certification authorities and operators. Of primary concern is operational safety, and closely connected pilot situation awareness and workload. A particular safety factor for operating VTOL vehicles that depend on propulsive lift for the majority of their operations and that are operated over urban terrain, is the management of energy and power needs along with power and energy reserves. These reserves are highly sensitive to the environment (mostly temperatures), and with VTOL, where the aircraft cannot simply glide to an emergency landing, management of energy reserves is not sufficient. This generates the need for thorough Trajectory Energy Management. This paper provides flight test results of the Trinity F9 drone developed by Quantum-Systems. Prescribed trajectories were flown based on operationally-relevant scenarios. Battery usage for the various flight segments was quantified. Results were compared to analytic models. A preliminary list of safety-of-flight parameters was developed to aid aircraft certification authorities. This research is intended to define some requirements for energy management such that the pilot can safely accomplish an intended profile and land with enough energy reserves to satisfy the intent of operation rules 91.151 (VFR reserves) and 91.167 (IFR reserves). In the context of trajectory energy management, there is a spectrum of automation tools that may assist the pilot. For example, common avionics systems with moving maps display range rings that help the pilot manage fuel state. These systems make assumptions based on current ground speed, fuel flow and fuel reserve requirements. Requirements for similar tools for VTOL aircraft that employ electric propulsion do not yet exist and must be defined based on prototype algorithm development, simulation results, and flight test data. For higher levels of automation, the Trajectory Energy Management System must be able to define an optimum trajectory for a VTOL aircraft and then couple to an automatic control system to execute that nominal trajectory. This system would need to account for disturbances and off nominal conditions. This project provides solutions and data to help the FAA develop performance estimation tools, flight safety assessment tools and the associated means of compliance for Trajectory Energy Management Systems. For the flight test program an operationally relevant reference mission profile was developed and flown using a tilt rotor aircraft in 14 flights and total flight time of 2.5 hours. Vertical flight was found to use about 5 to 7 times more power than in horizontal flight. Vertical takeoff and landing used about 60% of the total flight energy in a fraction of time spent in cruise. Therefore vertical flight is most concerning for operational safety. Finally, lessons learned through the execution of the Trinity F9 flight test program are documented in this paper.",,,"Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Federal Aviation Administration, Small Aircraft Directorate, Kansas City, MO; Federal Aviation Administration, Small Aircraft Directorate, Kansas City, MO; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL"

As the drawbacks of conventional flowmeter measurement error produced by the heterogeneous phase or velocity distribution, a measurement technique combining an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and an ultrasound Doppler (UD) sensor is proposed.

The system also equips the horizontal scaling system with the resource deletion strategy RRS, which enables the system to handle bursty workloads better. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a passive strategy based on weighted metric thresholds and an active strategy based on ARIMA prediction. The results of multiple experiments show that the ARIMA-prediction-based strategy has the problem of decreasing prediction accuracy in the late stage of the experiment, demonstrating the limitations of the ARIMA model in the real-time scaling system.

Yu,2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR),IEEE Conferences,1,"We present a novel control method for an omnidirectional robotic platform for gait training. This mobile platform or “walker” provides trunk support and allows unrestricted motion of the pelvis simultaneously. In addition to helping the user maintain balance and preventing falls, the walker combines two types of therapeutic intervention: forward propulsion of the trunk and partial body weight support (BWS). The core of the walker's control is an admittance controller that maximizes the platform's horizontal mobility by optimizing the virtual mass of the admittance model. Said mass represents the best tradeoff between a low-frequency oscillation mode that becomes more damped as the virtual mass decreases, and a high-frequency mode that becomes less damped simultaneously and hence could destabilize the system. Forward propulsion of the trunk is aided by a horizontal force that is modulated with the patient's gait speed and turning rate to ensure easy adaptation. BWS is provided by a second, independent admittance controller that generates a spring-like upward force. In an initial study, a stroke patient was able to walk stably in the platform, as evidenced by the absence of oscillations associated with an excessively low virtual mass. A progressive increase in the patient's self-selected speed, along with greater uniformity in the instantaneous velocity, suggest that forward propulsion was effective in compensating the patient's own propulsion deficit.",,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore"

Liu,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),IEEE Conferences,0,"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is a significant yet challenging classification task due to the inter-class similarities and intra-class variations. Recently, a large number of methods can extract expression features effectively. However, the intra-class variations mainly caused by various uncertainties (such as identity, pose, and occlusion) are difficult to capture in advance, and the cost of labeling these uncertainties is high. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Mirrored Self-supervised Learning FER (MSL-FER) method. The ground truth of self-supervised learning comes from the data itself rather than from human annotations, and horizontal inversion preserves emotional information without altering the facial structure. Specifically, MSL-FER introduces a binary classification task to recognize the 2D mirror operation in a self-supervised learning method. And we also combine our MSL-FER with an attention network to discriminate features along its dimensions selectively. Experiments on two public wild FER datasets show that our MSL-FER approach outperforms the baseline and other state-of-the-art methods with 87.92% on RAF-DB and 70.68% on FER2013.",Facial Expression Recognition;Self-supervised Learning;Attention,,"College of Oceanography and Space Informatics, China University of Petroleum, East China; College of Oceanography and Space Informatics, China University of Petroleum, East China; College of Oceanography and Space Informatics, China University of Petroleum, East China; College of Oceanography and Space Informatics, China University of Petroleum, East China; College of Oceanography and Space Informatics, China University of Petroleum, East China"

Shiwei,2021,2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),IEEE Conferences,4,"Terminals in heterogeneous wireless networks perform horizontal handovers in a homogeneous network and vertical handovers between different types of networks. The decision of access location depends on not only the physical layer parameters, such as signal quality, hut also other attributes as communication cost, handover delay, and so on. If the vertical handover decision is classified into a multi-attribute decision problem, the difficulty of solving the attribute weights increases, with the increasing number of decision attributes. Moreover, it is more subjective to compare the relative importance of two attributes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a vertical handoff decision algorithm in heterogeneous wireless networks, which is based on an improved KNN with less sample data and lower complexity.

Among the laser scanners, one of the most popular are the lidars using multiple laser range finders (LRF). They emit a set of 16, 32, 64 or 128 laser beams with different elevation angle. The set of beams can rotate around the vertical axis providing different azimuths. This design causes a very good horizontal resolution but very poor vertical resolution. Moreover, while scanning from stationary position, these scanners get always the same points because each laser beam is emitted always in the same direction. Due to these facts, typical mobile robot tasks like robot localization, mapping, object recognition and collision avoidance, can easily fail. In this paper we present a design of a new 3D laser scanner using a single laser range finder and two optical elements rotating around the same axis. Our design ensures significantly bigger vertical resolution than currently available 3D scanners and provides possibility of increasing point cloud density.

The method of auxiliary sources (MAS) which can directly locate a UXO-like target is presented here without forward calculation. With a brief description of single dipole model for a UXO-like target, the basis of target location with magnetic field and scalar magnetic potential is deduced theoretically. Auxiliary sources made of elementary magnetic dipoles on a plane are applied to estimate the equivalent scalar magnetic potential from the measured magnetic field. Firstly, the moment of elementary magnetic dipoles is estimated by matching the measured magnetic field with the auxiliary sources modeled field. Then, the equivalent scalar magnetic potential is calculated with these elementary magnetic dipoles without a priori knowledge of the target’s location. Finally, the position is calculated directly with the measured magnetic field and the equivalent scalar magnetic potential. The responses of four UXOs excited by a z-component square transmitting coil are recorded by a 9×9 3-component receiving coil array. With the auxiliary sources on a plane under the measurement grid, the equivalent scalar magnetic potential is calculated precisely.

By introducing new optimization variables to substitute the hyperbolic functions of step time, the derivatives of the objective function and feasibility constraints are analytically derived, thus reduces the computational cost. Then, taking the generated horizontal CoM trajectory, step times and step locations as inputs, CoM height and angular momentum changes are optimized by the second layer nonlinear model predictive control.

We formulate a resilient reinforcement learning (RL) training setup which (a) generates episodic trajectories injecting adversarial actions at primary control reference signals of the grid forming (GFM) inverters and (b) trains the RL agents (or controllers) to alleviate the impact of the injected adversaries. To circumvent data-sharing issues and concerns for proprietary privacy in multi-party-owned networked grids, we bring in the aspects of federated machine learning and propose a novel Fed-RL algorithm to train the RL agents. To this end, the conventional horizontal Fed-RL approaches using decoupled independent environments fail to capture the coupled dynamics in a networked microgrid, which leads us to propose a multi-agent vertically federated variation of actor-critic algorithms, namely federated soft actor-critic (FedSAC) algorithm. We created a customized simulation setup encapsulating microgrid dynamics in the GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform compatible with the OpenAI Gym interface for training RL agents.

1361,Robot-CT Scanning Oriented Synchronous Trajectory Planning of a Dual-Manipulator System,S. Zhang; M. Yuan; X. Zhang,2023,2023 42nd Chinese Control Conference (CCC),IEEE Conferences,0,"At present, most CT scanning systems adopt the traditional horizontal O-frame, suspension or C-arm structures, which can not balance the flexibility and functionality. With the development of robot technology, CT scanning systems based on manipulators have gradually emerged. However, limited by the motion accuracy of the manipulator, most researchers sacrifice the flexibility or increase the mass to improve the accuracy. To overcome this limitation, a new master-slave teaching-based scanning method is proposed to improve the scanning accuracy of the dual-manipulator Robot-CT system with the auxiliary function of rigid links. First, a rigid link is employed to connect the end effectors of the two manipulators. Next, the sampled trajectory of each joint of the slave-manipulator is recorded while the master-manipulator pulls the slave-manipulator to perform a circular motion. Finally, when carrying out the scanning, the dual-manilupator system reproduces the recorded joint trajectory without the rigid element, thereby improving the accuracy of the dual-manipulator CT scanning system to achieve a high-accuracy spatiotemporal synchronization and alignment of pose. To this end, a fifth-order spline interpolation is used to interpolate the sampled trajectory of each joint of the slave-manipulator, which allows it to perfectly reproduce the joint trajectory recorded during the teaching process and ensures the smoothness of the angular velocity and acceleration curves. Simulations are investigated and the corresponding results confirm the effectiveness of the trajectory planning method of the slave-manipulator.",CT;Robot-CT;Dual-manipulator;Master-Slave;Rigid Link;Fifth-order Spline Interpolation,,"Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, College of Artificial Intelligence, Nankai University, Tianjin, P.

Wu,2022,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,9,"Further detection will increase traffic safety by perceiving unexpected traffic incidents earlier, allowing more time to make decisions and implement these decisions. Therefore, this article attempts to extend the detection range by using a low-channel roadside light detection and range sensor (LiDAR) sensor due to its low price and widespread employment in the future. The proposed method contains two major parts: static background construction and traffic objects detection. For static background construction, successive point cloud frames data were used to cover the most LiDAR scanning horizontal–vertical angle and obtain background information ultimately. Furthermore, the constructed static background was optimized to reduce the missing of the far range points and the occurrence of noise points. For vehicle and road user detection, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used to identify the near-range traffic objects. For far-range traffic objects detection, the trajectories of objects were extracted based on their moving direction and distance, and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to filter the noise point and identify the vehicle and road user points. The experimental results show that the static background construction with the proposed method is more effective and uses fewer point cloud data. The average maximum detection range can be up to 100, 100, and 85 m for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, respectively. The average precision (AP) and recall are 95.71% and 90.62%, respectively, which are better than the previous studies.",Extending detection range;far-range detection;roadside light detection and range sensor (LiDAR) data;static background construction;traffic perception,,"Department of Traffic Information and Control Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Department of Traffic Information and Control Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Department of Traffic Information and Control Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"

However, there is a lack of observability analyses for MIMUs. Whether the state is observable or not is closely related to whether Kalman filtering can accurately estimate the error state. In this paper, the observability of MIMUs on a continuously rotating base is analyzed on the basis of simulation and collected real data. The results show that MIMUs cannot realize self-alignment because of their large heading errors in the static state. Kalman filtering can estimate the heading angle effectively in a short time by rotating continuously around the z-axis, and it can estimate the z-axis accelerometer bias quickly, as well as the z-axis gyro drift after a period of time. However, it is impossible to estimate the gyro drift and accelerometer bias in the horizontal plane because the horizontal modulated inertial sensor errors that are integrated over time will suppress the effect of errors. Additionally, the horizontal errors can be solved by the north-seeking algorithm.

Xu,2023,2023 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Droplet size distribution is a key parameter to predict the pressure drop and heat transfer in annular flow. A novel fiber optical reflectometer technique is used to measure the droplet size of annular flow in a DN50 horizontal pipe. The experiment is carried out in the superficial gas velocity range from 15 m/s to 18 m/s and superficial liquid velocity range from 0.04 m/s to 0.35 m/s. The results reveal that droplet size is strongly dependent on the gas and liquid flow velocities. When the superficial liquid velocity increases from 0.04 m/s to 0.35 m/s, the droplet Sauter diameter increases from 190 μm. to 337 μm. on average. Then, based on the available experiment data in the previous literature, five published models of droplet size are summarized and evaluated, and the differences among these models are analyzed. Finally, a new empirical model is established for the prediction of droplet size, which takes into account the effects of Reynolds number, liquid viscosity, pipe diameter, gas-liquid density ratio and system pressure.

Subsequently, the horizontal motion is computed from multi-body dynamics which we approximate by solving an overdetermined boundary value problem via spline collocation based on quintic polynomials. The proposed algorithm is an improvement of our previous method, which used a parametric torso height optimization for vertical and cubic spline collocation for horizontal components. The novel center of mass motion improves stability, especially for stepping up and down platforms. Moreover, the new method leads to a less complex overall algorithm since it removes the necessity of manually tuned parameters and strongly simplifies the incorporation of boundary values.

Recently, horizontal representation-based approaches outperform projection-based solutions, because the distortions can be effectively removed by compressing the spherical data in the vertical direction. However, these methods ignore the distortion distribution prior and are limited to unbalanced receptive fields, e.g., the receptive fields are sufficient in the vertical direction and insufficient in the horizontal direction. Differently, a vertical representation compressed in another direction can offer implicit distortion prior and enlarge horizontal receptive fields. In this paper, we combine the two different representations and propose a novel 360° semantic segmentation solution from a complementary perspective. Our network comprises three modules: a feature extraction module, a bi-directional compression module, and an ensemble decoding module. First, we extract multi-scale features from a panorama. Then, a bi-directional compression module is designed to compress features into two complementary low-dimensional representations, which provide content perception and distortion prior. Furthermore, to facilitate the fusion of bi-directional features, we design a unique self distillation strategy in the ensemble decoding module to enhance the interaction of different features and further improve the performance.

The proof consists of two-steps: First, we show it for SISO systems by using the fact that the covariance matrix of input-output history for SISO systems is invertible. MIMO systems, however, do not have this property because the state estimation from the history is redundant, in other words, the aforementioned map has to be a horizontal matrix. To overcome this problem, we next introduce the modal decomposition to the convergence analysis, thereby guaranteeing the global linear convergence for generic MIMO systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through a numerical simulation.",,,"Department of Mechanical and Intelligent Systems Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Mechanical and Intelligent Systems Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"

Li,2022,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,IEEE Journals,9,"Accurate orientation estimation using low-cost inertial and magnetic sensors is important. However, since the magnetometer measurements affect pitch and roll estimates in addition to yaw determination, the resultant accuracy reduction under magnetic disturbances is adverse for special occasions where high-precision pitch and roll estimates are essential. This article presents a double-extended Kalman filter (DEKF) orientation estimator with unit quaternion as output, which decouples magnetometer effects on pitch and roll estimates by decomposing the orientation into tilt quaternion and heading quaternion. The tilt quaternion, including pitch and roll information, is estimated by the first EKF where accelerometer and gyroscope measurements are processed and the inaccurate heading information is discarded. The heading quaternion, solely describing the yaw orientation, is determined by the second EKF, which fuses the vertical component of angular rate measurements and the horizontal component of magnetic measurements. True quaternion is denoted by the multiplicative of tilt and heading quaternions. The separate property of DEKF limits the influences of magnetic disturbances on yaw estimation, making the pitch and roll angles immune to them. Experiment results show that the proposed method solves the coupled disturbance problem without losing accuracy.",Extended Kalman filter (EKF);magnetic disturbances;orientation decoupling;orientation estimation;quaternion,,"Center for Robotics, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Center for Robotics, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Center for Robotics, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Center for Robotics, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Center for Robotics, School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"

Shajahan,2023,"2023 3rd International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)",IEEE Conferences,0,"This paper proposes a novel technique of an Autonomous Drone landing on top of a moving Naval Vessel Base using Vision-Based Robot Control. To achieve an effective landing a camera is fixed under the drone which captures the images and detects the movement of the landing base. The landing base on top of the vessel is specially designed with a nested tag which is scanned by the fixed camera on the drone from a high altitude. This nested tag is a fiducial marker that is used by the imaging system of the drone as a point of reference in the Naval Vessel Base for precise landing. The controller is designed in the image coordinate frame captured by the imaging system on the drone with the help of the Jacobian Matrix. Whether the vessel remains stationary or moving, it always trembles, especially, when a vessel experiences bad weather at sea, it will be quite challenging for the drone to land on the trembling Naval Vessel Base. These unexpected movements cause the landing tag to disorient from the horizontal view of the captured frames, which makes it difficult to obtain the expected mid-point of the tag. To overcome this complication the translational and rotational motions of the drone are decoupled from the camera using the Virtual Camera Method where the mid-point of the tag is set as the feature point which helps to obtain the expected position during the horizontal plane disorientation of the tag image captured by the camera from the drone. Additionally, Kalman Filter is employed in the imaging system to reduce the observation noise so that precise estimation of the feature point can be achieved.",Drone Landing;Precision Landing;Autonomous Drone;Nested Tag,,"Dept. of Elec. and Comm.

The absolute geomagnetic measurement generally adopts a combined measurement mode. Owing to differences in the principles of different magnetometers, it is difficult to comprehensively apply absolute data. To address this problem, we propose a novel automatic measurement model for the absolute geomagnetic total field and directions. Gearing toward field mobile measurement, we developed an integrated vector magnetometer using an improved Overhauser total-field sensor and a miniaturized spherical magnetic field generator. Component test results obtained for an artificial magnetic field generator show that the expanded uncertainty of Overhauser sensor with reduced dimensions was still below 0.10 nT, and the magnetic gradient formed by the applied bias fields had no negative effect on the performance of Overhauser sensor. In overall tests conducted in geomagnetic observatories, between the proposed magnetometer and a standard manually operated declination–inclination magnetometer, the differences of inclination and declination were only 14.40” and 12.96”, respectively. The noises of total field, horizontal component, and declination measured by the proposed magnetometer were 0.02 nT, 0.08 nT, and 0.47”, respectively, which are much lower than those of a state-of-the-art standard variometer.

But unlike natural general images, remote sensing images are usually high-resolution, which are consist of complex backgrounds and various randomly arranged targets. Remote sensing images usually have the characteristics of large intra-class differences and huge inter-class similarity, which make it difficult for the network to focus on the main objects in the scene, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we propose the Triple Attention Vision Transformers (TaViT) network to solve this problem. The backbone of TaViT is mainly composed of two branches, namely Dual Attention Vision Transformers (DaViT) and Branch Attention Module (BA Module). DAViT uses the self-attention mechanism of “spatial tokens” and “channel tokens” to capture the features of the global context. The BA Module aggregates the features of each channel along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, and continuously provides rich local details for the network.

Using the VR, the mechanical frequency asymmetry (Δf) is identified and electrically reduced to Δf/f < 2 ppm. After the removal of VR linear component, the angle output is digitally corrected by modeling and subtraction of the angle dependent bias (ADB). The final angle error is limited by electronics noise, which is 0.01 deg rms at an output data rate (ODR) of 50 Hz.

To improve the Q-factor of inductors, the voltage-controlled oscillator employs bond wires as the inductors of the resonators. A transient-analysis-compatible equivalent circuit is proposed to precisely estimate the influence of mutual inductance, parasitic components and silicon substrate. Possible phenomena of oscillation mode ambiguity and oscillation failure are analyzed to be relative with the magnetic coupling between bond wires. An equation is derived to set up the relation among oscillation mode, bond wire coupling and frequency ratio of adjacent oscillators. And a costless placement reorder method is proposed to prevent the oscillator cores from oscillating failure and mode ambiguity.

Furthermore, a rotor offset design has been adopted, in which the tilting rotors are offset from the tilting axle by a certain distance. In this configuration, the required distance between the wall and the platform is reduced, improving stability and increasing the opportunity to enhance power efficiency. However, owing to the rotor offset, the servo motor slows down and the tilting angle is one-way constrained. These conditions can cause a critical issue with the conventional control method.

Mainly focused on reproducing the end effector interaction with the inherent terrain, this paper introduces a novel discrete element method (DEM)-based approach to determine forces and torques acting on the lander's scoop during the sample acquisition process. An accurate force feedback from the terrain on the scoop is required by fault-detection and autonomous decision-making algorithms to identify when the requested torque on the robotic arm's joints exceeds the maximum available torque. Knowledge of the terrain force feedback significantly helps evaluating the arm's links structural properties and properly selecting actuators for the joints. Models available in literature constitute a partial representation of the dynamics of the interaction. As an example, Balovnev derived an analytical expression of the vertical and horizontal force acting on a bucket while collecting a sample as a function of its geometry and velocity, soil parameters and reached depth. Although the model represents an adequate approximation of the two force components, it ignores the direction orthogonal to the scoop motion and neglects the torque. This work relies on DEM analysis to compensate for analytical models' deficiencies and inaccuracies, i. e. provide force and torque 3D vectors, defined in the moving reference (body) frame attached to the scoop, at each instant of the sample collection process. Results from the first presented analysis relate to the specific OceanWATERS sampling strategy, which consists of collecting the sample through five consecutive passes with increasing depth, each pass following the same circular-linear-circular trajectory. Data is collected given a specific scoop design interacting with two types of bulk materials, which may characterize the surface of icy planetary bodies: snow and ice. Although specifically concerned with the OceanWATERS design, this first analysis provides the expected force trends for similar sampling strategies and allows to deduce phenomenological information about the general scooping process. In order to further instruct the community on the use of DEM tools as a solution to the sampling collection problem, two more analyses have been carried out, mainly focused on reducing the DEM computation time, which increases with a decrease in particle size. After running a set of identical simulations, where the only changing parameter is the size of the spherical particle, it is observed that the resulting force trajectories, starting from a given particle size, converge to the true trend. It is deducible that a further decrease in size yields negligible improvements in the accuracy, while it sensibly increases computation time. A final analysis aims at discussing limitations of approximating bulk material particles having a complex shape, e. g. ice fragments, with spheres, by comparing force trends resulting in the two cases for the same simulation scenario.",,,"USRA, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; SETI Institute, 189 Bernardo Ave, Suite 200, Mountain View, CA; NSTRF, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN; KBR, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA"

Yu,2021,2021 22nd International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT),IEEE Conferences,0,"With the rapid development of the electronic industry, the demand on mini-size, low power consumption and high reliability becomes inevitable to electronic products. Based on Moore's law decreasing the feature size of the integrated circuits is approaching a bottleneck. Recently wafer-level vertical miniaturization 3D Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) package integration becomes an alternative solution to breakthrough the bottleneck of Moore's law down scaling in design, process and cost. Correspondingly, due to copper's higher conductivity, less resistant to electromigration, copper is widely used material to fill the TSV via. Conventionally the copper metal layer deposition and planarization process contains several process steps: PVD, ECP, annealing, and CMP. Electrochemical plating (ECP) is a key process for copper via filling, which is required to achieving void-free and seam-free via filling, and with a minimized the copper overburden thickness. In wafer level mass production, the thinner overburden is beneficial to reduce wafer stress and shorten process time and reduce process cost. The ECP process's performance is dependent on seed layer pre-treatment, chemistry, chemistry mass transfer, and plating current etc [1]. In this study, the 300mm wafer is pre-treated in a pre-wet chamber by DIW; after that the wafer will be located in a horizontal plating chuck and face down immerged in the plating chemistry with protecting voltage and current; the plating chamber will control the flow rate distribution, plating current, distance between anode and plating rotation speed.

The industry is constantly researching and developing solutions for vertical and horizontal interoperation of systems, some concepts being already well-grounded. One of the main issues is the interfacing. The industry accepted the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol as of high importance for interoperability in the IIoT context. The automotive industry is considered to have a separate path, because of a somehow more rigid approach towards communication and data integration. But, car-to-infrastructure and even car-to-car communication are requiring data exchange and implicitly a newer approach from the automotive industry. Recently, VSOMEIP (Scalable service Oriented MiddlewarE over IP from Genivi) interfacing is more and more present in automotive, its main focus being to assure interoperation between the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The current paper proposes a VSOMEIP - OPC UA gateway conceptual solution that assures car interfacing in the IIoT context. The proof of concept is implemented regarding AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) requirements, using a tailored operating system on an embedded device.

For HAUV, the trans-media ability under the wind, wave, and current is a unique technical difficulty. This paper calculates the wind, wave, and current loads of HAUV under different draft depths based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. In the uniform current condition, when the arm is completely submerged under water, the horizontal hydrodynamic force on the HAUV body increases by about 50% compared to when the arm is completely out of water. With the decrease of draft depth, the hydrodynamic torque of HAUV under the uniform current action shows a downward trend, then a reverse increase, and a reverse decrease to 0. The calculation results show that the wind has little influence on the HAUV body near the water surface. The wave force and torque of HAUV are different under different draft depths, particularly the time corresponding to the peak. At different waves, the hydrodynamic force and torque of HAUV are greatly different in the trend and peak.

1404,3-D FDTD Computation of Electromagnetic Fields Associated With Lightning Strikes to a Tower Climbed on a Trapezoidal Mountain,K. Arzag; Z. -E. Azzouz; Y. Baba; B. Ghemri,2019,IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility,IEEE Journals,14,"In this paper, we are interested in the study of electromagnetic (EM) field waveforms generated by a lightning strike to a tower located on a trapezoidal mountain. The latter has a height of 500 m and a steepness angle of slope of 45°. The EM field components are calculated at six points and in three directions from the tower. Among these six points, four of them are placed on a flat ground and located at close distances from the mountain bottom while the other two points are located on the mountain at close distances from the tower. Also, because of the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of the problem being treated, the computation is performed in three dimensions by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In this computation, the lightning channel is represented by the transmission line model extended to include a tall strike object. To evaluate the influence of the presence of mountain on the EM field waveforms, a comparison between the results obtained in the presence and absence of the mountain has been done. On the other hand, the ground conductivity effect on the EM field components has been also studied. At the end of this study, we show that the trapezoidal mountain shadowing effect causes a reduction of the vertical electric field calculated on a flat ground at close distances from the mountain bottom, while the field is enhanced on the top of the mountain. The same conclusion is drawn for the azimuthal magnetic field. Furthermore, the initial peaks of the vertical electric field and the azimuthal magnetic field, above the ground, have been attenuated because of the finite conductivity of ground. The horizontal electric fields above the ground are characterized by oscillations due to the presence of tower and mountain. The underground horizontal electric field and azimuthal magnetic field have the same waveforms as those obtained above the ground but with smaller magnitudes. Thus, the underground vertical electric is initially bipolar and then essentially zero. Finally, the 3-D-FDTD developed program was validated (see the Appendix).",Ground conductivity;lightning electromagnetic (EM) fields;three-dimensional (3-D) finite-difference time-domain (3-D-FDTD) method;tower;trapezoidal mountain,,"Department of Electrotechnics, University of Saida, Saida, Algeria; Department of Automatic and Control and the LDEE Laboratory, University of Sciences and Technology “MB” of Oran, Oran, Algeria; Department of Electrical Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Electrotechnics, University of Sciences and Technology “MB” of Oran, Oran, Algeria"
1405,Vertelas - Automated User-Controlled Vertical Elasticity in Existing Commercial Clouds,K. Qazi,2019,"2019 4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Security (ICCCS)",IEEE Conferences,1,"Cloud computing has become ubiquitous as a way for users to obtain scalable services. Commercial Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers offer pay-as-you-go Virtual Machines (VM) to users to run their applications. One of the main benefits of using IaaS is the ability to increase or decrease the size of a VM (amount of RAM, cpu, etc.) on demand, based on requirement. This approach is known as vertical elasticity, and results in reduced costs over the lifetime of an application for the user. However, most IaaS providers including Amazon and Google, do not offer vertical elasticity out-of-the-box. Instead, they offer horizontal elasticity, which is the ability to vary the number of VMs based on requirement. In a myriad of scenarios such as non-parallelizable applications and scientific computations, vertical elasticity instead of horizontal elasticity is a must to reduce costs. This paper proposes a framework called Vertelas, that users can utilize within their current cloud based VMs to achieve vertical elasticity and save costs. Vertelas automatically predicts the required resources, and moves the running application to smaller or larger VMs. By utilizing Linux container migrations, no modifications or support on the part of the service providers is required, making the approach provider-agnostic. Experimental evaluations on a real world IaaS provider (AWS), with real world load traces, demonstrate the substantial reductions in costs as opposed to running the application inside a single, fixed-size VM.",,,"Department of Computer, Science Manhattan College, NY, USA"

Indoor aerial robots often require a motion capture system for localization or employ simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms for navigation. The proposed strategy for GT-MAB localization can be accomplished using lightweight sensors on a weight-constrained platform like the GT-MAB. We train an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts the horizontal position and heading of the GT-MAB using video collected by an onboard monocular RGB camera. On the other hand, the height of the GT-MAB is estimated from measurements through a time-of-flight (ToF) single-beam laser sensor. The monocular camera and the single-beam laser sensor are sufficient for the localization algorithm to localize the GT-MAB in real time, achieving the averaged 3D positioning errors to be less than 20 cm, and the averaged heading errors to be less than 3 degrees. With the accuracy of our proposed localization method, we are able to use simple proportional-integral-derivative controllers to control the GT-MAB for waypoint navigation.

The motivation is to generate trajectory proposals to resolve conflicts based on current practices (imitation learning) as a way to get controller acceptability. The paper explores two distinct approaches. The first one takes a pilot point of view with a flight centred representation of the surrounding traffic, while the second one takes a controller point of view with a sector-based representation of the traffic. In addition, for the first approach, the traffic input is represented by an image going into a convolutional neural network, while in the second it is represented by a list of flights parameters going into a feed forward neural network.The case study addressed is to predict conflict free trajectories with a 5 minutes look-ahead. It relies on recorded traffic data from 2018 from a busy European en-route centre (Maastricht UAC) used to draw a 250k data set. This dataset was split in two 50% sub-sets: one with no change in vertical and/or horizontal dimension, the other with a change (change thresholds of 1000ft and 2NM determined statistically). The performance of both models is compared to a baseline to ensure a learning has been achieved. For the best model (sector based), the median deviations between the prediction and the true future locations are 0.4NM and 23ft ""with no change"", and 1.3NM and 500ft ""with change"". These results show that relevant information has been extracted and a mapping between inputs and outputs achieved. However, the prediction error remains quite significant compared to separation standards (5NM, 1000ft).Future work will investigate further both models, in particular analyze error (focus on bad performance cases patterns) and improving them, and later, adding other information (e.g. military areas, meteo).",,,"EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre, France; EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre, France; EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre, France"

The concept of look-ahead pursuit for 3-D path-following was extended from the planar ${\mathcal {L}_1}$ guidance, which has been widely adopted in the application of lateral guidance of fixed-wing drone. Decoupled implementation of the planar guidance action on each of the longitudinal (vertical) and lateral (horizontal) planes supplies longitudinal-lateral acceleration commands in two perpendicular planes which is well accepted by aviation engineers. The computation of the look-ahead point utilizes a finite and iterative numerical search method by introducing an auxiliary path-related parameter. Furthermore, additional implementation-specific details such as the modification of adaptive ${\mathcal {L}_1}$ length and the protection strategies ensuring wide applicability of the algorithm indeed guarantee certain necessity to be considered in real implementation of the guidance law. The improved schemes eliminate complicated coordinate transformations and are built on the path-independent assumption, thus making them easier to be adjusted between various types of paths, including discrete optimal trajectories.

A crucial feature of these vehicles is an accurate and robust positioning system. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) can achieve decimeter-level accuracy without the need for local reference stations. Nevertheless, the solution availability is affected by GNSS signal outages, which frequently occur in AVs driving scenarios. The integration with an inertial navigation system (INS) provides a continuous positioning solution; however, high-end inertial sensors are bulky and expensive. The recent improvements to the low-cost micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) sensors opened the way to utilize these sensors in high-precision applications. The objective of this work is to investigate the performance of integrating dual-frequency PPP with low-cost MEMS sensors for land vehicles on highways and suburban areas. Furthermore, the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) is used instead of the traditional INS system. RISS uses two horizontal accelerometers and one vertical gyroscope in addition to the vehicle odometer, eliminating two gyroscopes and one accelerometer compared to the full IMU system. The lower number of sensors contributes to reducing the error growth over time and reducing the system cost and complexity.

Under the traditional view at the element level, at least 2-bit phases are required because a 90° phase shift step is needed for conversion from linear polarization (LP) to circular polarization (CP). In this work, we found that the extra phase shifts (90°/ $- 90^{\circ })$  can be achieved by changing the global reference phase of the 0/1 coding arrangement in the spatially fed architecture, while 1-bit phase resolution is used in the element level.

The Rayleigh wave is widely used for detecting these surface defects. For replacing piezoelectric transducers with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for the surface inspection of metal materials, this article proposes a new magnet and coil combination consisting of a periodic-permanent-magnet (PPM) and a returned dislocation meander line coil. The returned dislocation meander line coil was developed using a traditional meander line coil, whose wires return from one side to another and shift for a certain distance. A 2-D finite-element simulation was conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed Rayleigh wave EMAT. The simulation results revealed that, compared with a large conventional magnet, the PPM increased the maximum magnetic flux density, and made the magnetic flux density distribution more concentrated on the specimen's surface, particularly below the coil. In the middle part of the coil, the PPM greatly increased the intensity of the horizontal magnetic field. Additionally, the returned dislocation meander line coil made full use of the strong magnetic field below the center of each small magnet and at the adjacent magnets.

1426,A Linear Extendable Phase-shift Controlled Multi-coil Transmitter Architecture for Wireless Power Transfer with 3D Magnetic Field Shaping,N. Kang; C. Ma; M. Liu,2020,2020 IEEE PELS Workshop on Emerging Technologies: Wireless Power Transfer (WoW),IEEE Conferences,5,"Wireless power transmission (WPT) systems operating at MHz have advantages of small size and a high tolerance for coils misalignment. There is an urgent need for existing MHz WPT systems to improve coupling coils efficiency and positional freedom of the receiver simultaneously. There exist some ways for improving coils efficiency and positional freedom of the receiver, such as introducing repeater coils and employing special coils structures. However, lack of magnetic field strength can limit the freedom of the receiver, and the excessive coupling may cause inefficiency in coils. This paper proposes a phase-shift controlled multi-coil transmitter architecture. The architecture is linear extendable and it enables the 3D magnetic field shaping, which helps to improve the coupling coils efficiency and the spatial freedom of the receiver. The design of the compensation capacitors of the transmitting coils is discussed to achieve the optimal operation for the high-frequency power amplifier (PA) when considering the effect of the cross-coupling among transmitting coils. The mathematic model for the 3D magnetic field shaping is derived to prove the concept of the approach. The calculation results show the capability of 3D magnetic field shaping when using a two-coil transmitter as an example. The experimental results match well with the theoretical analysis and the simulation results. Three WPT systems are studied in the paper. Compared with the single transmitter system (STS) and the two-coil transmitter system (TTS) without phase-shift control (PSC), the TTS with PSC can maintain higher system efficiency in three degrees of freedom (vertical movement, horizontal movement, flip with fixed axis). In particular, only the TTS with PSC can work when the receiving coil is perpendicular to the transmitting coils. Therefore, due to the ability to shape the 3D magnetic field, the linear extendable multi-coil transmitter architecture with PSC has advantages in terms of the receiver freedom and the coupling coils efficiency.",wireless power transfer;MHz;phase-shift control;multi-coil transmitter architecture;two-coil transmitter,,"University of Michigan-Shanghai, Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; University of Michigan-Shanghai, Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, US"

Pikul,2022,2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),IEEE Conferences,0,"Soft robotic actuators are safe and adaptable devices with inherent compliance, which makes them attractive for manipulating delicate and complex objects. Researchers have integrated stiff materials into soft actuators to increase their force capacity and direct their deformation. However, these embedded materials have largely been pre-prescribed and static, which constrains the actuators to a predetermined range of motion. In this work, electroadhesive (EA) clutches integrated on a single-chamber soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) provide local programmable stiffness modulation to control the actuator deformation. We show that activating different clutch patterns inflates a silicone membrane into pyramidal, round, and plateau shapes. Curvatures from these shapes are combined during actuation to apply forces on both a 3.7 g and 820 g object along five different degrees of freedom (DoF). The actuator workspace is up to 12 mm for light objects. Clutch deactivation, which results in local elastomeric expansion, rapidly applies forces up to 3.2 N to an object resting on the surface and launches a 3.7 g object in controlled directions. The actuator also rotates a heavier, 820 g, object by 5 degrees and rapidly restores it to horizontal alignment after clutch deactivation. This actuator is fully powered by a 5 V battery, AA battery, DC-DC transformer, and 4.5 V (63 g) DC air pump. These results demonstrate a first step towards realizing a soft actuator with high DoF shape change that preserves the inherent benefits of pneumatic actuation while gaining the electrical controllability and strength of EA clutches.

However, they face a complex bifurcation environment, and magnetic control strategies targeting a single pathway limit the operational efficiency of the targeting task. In this letter, we propose a cooperative control strategy of magnetic microrobots in bifurcated microfluidic channels. A nanoparticle microrobot can be disassembled into two by a dynamic magnetic field. The microrobot with a length of 3 mm needs to set the rotation frequency of the magnetic field to about 1.7 Hz. The velocity of the microrobot in the microfluidic channel is inversely proportional to the angle of contact between it and the microfluidic wall. Take advantage of this velocity property, a cooperative control strategy based on environmental heterogeneity to control the horizontal distance difference between two sub-microrobots is proposed. The control strategy is experimentally verified in 2-D space with an error within 1 mm. The integrated tasks of disassembly, cooperative control and reassembly are completed.

It is first proved that there exists a crisp solution to a fuzzy linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. This proof creates a bridge such that multidimensional RDM arithmetic that has been devoted to linear functions so far could be entered into some problems with nonlinear functions. Then, an algorithm is proposed for the consensus of the MASs with uncertainty. Here, by proving the existence of a crisp solution for fuzzy LMI, we are able to prove that the proposed algorithm can ensure achieving consensus. Furthermore, the gain coefficients obtained for this fuzzy system are crisp numbers and can be applied to real systems in practical applications.

Here, the feasibility of a simple scheme for spin-Hall torque driven localized writing of chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain wall (DW) pairs at a chosen location in AFM nano stripes is investigated. Short voltage pulses causing in-plane current-injection across transverse contacts in the heavy metal trigger a localized horizontal boundary-nucleated reverse AFM domain that propagates throughout the width to the opposite boundary, defining a locally written DW pair without affecting information in other parts of the device. The nucleation mechanism is examined, indicating exchange torque governing. A diagram of the number of DW-pairs written as a function of applied writing pulse amplitude and pulse duration is shown for a generic antiferromagnet, illustrating the degree of control required of the excitation protocol. Simulations of write and drive pulses are also presented, showing that the slight current bending around the writing contacts does not impose any significant pinning nor nucleation of unwanted textures for a typical driving amplitude. The advantages of this simple scheme are that it does not require any component for vertical spin-polarized current injection nor lasers for writing as in previous proposals.",Antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain wall (DW);AFM memory;atomistic spin dynamics;nucleation;spin–orbit torque,,"Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory, Hitachi Europe Limited, Cambridge, U.K."

OHTA,2020,2020 IEEE 92nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2020-Fall),IEEE Conferences,4,"High altitude platform station (HAPS) has attracted significant attention as a new communication platform for disaster countermeasures because it can cover an ultra-wide area at once as well as enable direct communication with terrestrial mobile terminals. In the HAPS system, it is necessary to form multiple cells to accommodate high communication traffic at service area. For a multi-cell configuration, HAPS has a problem that the service area (footprint) projected on the ground is displaced as the platform moves, which results in frequent handovers and degradation of the communication quality. If the coverage area is more than a 50 km radius, it is difficult for the conventional planar array antennas to overcome this problem. To address this issue, we proposed a footprint fixation control method using a cylindrical array antenna. Because the antenna consists of a circular array in the horizontal plane and a linear array in the vertical plane, it can three-dimensionally control the beam; hence, it can easily compensate for footprint displacement even in the coverage area of 100 km radius. In this paper, we report on a prototype development of service link antenna system based on the proposed method and show that the proposed footprint fixation control can be achieved using real equipment from the measurement results of the beam pattern and the verification of dynamic beam steering control.",HAPS;Footprint Fixation;Cylindrical array antenna;Pseudo-inverse matrix;Experiment,,"Technology Research Laboratory, SoftBank Corp, Tokyo, Japan; Technology Research Laboratory, SoftBank Corp, Tokyo, Japan; Technology Research Laboratory, SoftBank Corp, Tokyo, Japan"

The considered total objective function is the sum of the private objective functions corresponding to each robot, which are used to evaluate their location choices. To avoid the large horizontal component force on the multi-robot system during lifting, a coupled equality constraint is introduced to the formulated distributed optimization problem. The feasibility constraints of the optimal location are also considered in this paper. A novel distributed continuous-time algorithm is proposed to solve the collaborative object lifting task for second-order multi-robot systems. Each robot only needs to access its local evaluation function, local variables, and the information exchanged between neighbors. The proposed algorithm does not require exchanging location variables or velocity variables, which effectively prevents privacy leakage.

Yue,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,1,"Global warming has become an issue of increasing worldwide concern. At present, the most direct way to solve this problem is to control carbon emissions. In our paper, carbon tax policy is injected into a two-stage supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers. We establish six game models according to the relationship (competitive or cooperative) between the retailers and three power structures (manufacturer Stackelberg (MS), retailer Stackelberg (RS), and vertical Nash (VN)) between the two retailers and the manufacturer. We then adopt the inverse induction method to derive optimal pricing decisions for each model. Optimal profits for supply chain members are obtained. Finally, we analyse: i) the effects of competition and cooperation between the two retailers on equilibrium results; ii) the effects of the three possible power structures existing between the manufacturer and the two retailers on equilibrium results; and especially iii) the effect of the carbon tax rate on pricing decision and the profits of the supply chain. We find that the different power structure and the horizontal relationship between the two retailers have important influence on equilibrium results. Further, the change of carbon tax rate have different influence on pricing under the different power structure and the horizontal relationship between the two retailers. When the government adjusts the carbon tax rate, it should fully consider the different power structure and the horizontal relationship for two-stage supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers. Although the implementation of the carbon tax policy reduces the corporate profits, it reduces the total carbon emission.

For this reason, the article does quantitative analysis on the induced velocity of propellers and propeller thrust of a multi-rotor UAV.

1457,A Two-Layer Trajectory Tracking Control Scheme of Manipulator Based on ELM-SMC for Autonomous Robotic Vehicle,X. Wang; D. Wang; M. Du; K. Song; Y. Ni; Y. Li,2023,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,IEEE Early Access Articles,1,"With the development of autonomous driving technology, some special vehicles should also be developed into autonomous driving vehicles. The robotic vehicles are widely used in engineering operations, and the robotic manipulator is a common tool mounted on robotic vehicles. The autonomous driving of robotic vehicles requires not only automatic movement, but also the automation of the robotic manipulator drive system. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive trajectory tracking control of manipulator based on sliding mode control (SMC), which can more accurately describe the joint space movement of the manipulator system under multi task coupling and external interference. Considering the multi-tasking situation, the influence of obstacle avoidance and base tilt on the trajectory of manipulator is investigated by using extreme learning machine (ELM), and the framework of machine learning is established. The output based on ELM-SMC is used as the bottom-layer control. Then an effective trajectory compensation method is proposed as the top-level control to avoid the error accumulation in the periodic repeated operation of the manipulator. Finally, the application effect of trajectory error tracking and compensation of manipulator in complex tasks of dynamic environment is verified by simulation and experiments, which lays a foundation for the stability control of manipulator in practical complex engineering applications. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to solve the problem of poor trajectory tracking control accuracy of the manipulator caused by the change of the direction of the manipulator base. It is suitable for the high-precision position control of the manipulator assembled on the mobile robotic vehicle. Nowadays, the autonomous driving technology is developing rapidly, and the automation of traffic will be widely popularized in the future. Therefore, we should not only pay attention to the autonomous driving function of passenger vehicles, but also give consideration to the autonomous driving technology of robotic vehicles applied in engineering. It not only needs to complete the driving function, but also needs to ensure the reliable operation of the manipulator. In this paper, we mathematically deduce the control model of the manipulator. Then, we use SMC as the trajectory tracking control method of the manipulator, and use ELM to estimate the trajectory error caused by the end trajectory of the manipulator in the non-horizontal state of the base. Furthermore, we propose an optimization algorithm to optimize the compensation coefficient of cubic spline and give a reasonable compensation scheme. Through simulation and experiments, it is preliminarily verified that the schemes proposed in this paper are feasible, but they lack the application verification in the actual robotic vehicles, and the model fitting part of machine learning is completed with the help of the host computer, and the calculation ability of the controller of the actual manipulator may also be the limitation of completing this scheme.",Robotic vehicles;robotics and automation;trajectory tracking;sliding mode control;machine learning,,"College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; China North Vehicle Research Institute, Beijing, China; China North Vehicle Research Institute, Beijing, China; China North Vehicle Research Institute, Beijing, China"

1477,Heading Calibration in Robot Soccer ERSOW using Line Landmark on The Field,F. Lui Hakim Ihsan; R. Adryantoro Priambudi; M. Mobed Bachtiar; I. Kumianto Wibowo,2020,2020 International Electronics Symposium (IES),IEEE Conferences,1,"This paper will present the heading calibration which is used on the Ersow's robot using line sensors. The robot must have the capabilities of avoiding obstacles, kicks the ball, and localization. All of those abilities are dependent on the robot heading data in the form of an angular degree unit. The drawback of the heading data is getting worse when the sensor is activated in a long period. This happens because IMU sensor is drifting along the time that causes a shifting orientation perception. This condition will create an enormous error in the robot system. The proposed way to solve this problem is calibrating the IMU data each necessary. The robot is placed in the field by looking for unique features. In this case, is the horizontal lines. We are using a microcontroller-based line sensor with an independent embedded microcontroller. The purposes of using the line sensors are the fast computation and the cheapest hardware to be built. The line sensor is expected to produce deviation data that is eligible to send towards Artificial Intelligent processed. Based on the result of the experiment average error by drifting robot heading -1.67 degree in every minute. The average error value with robot speed at 10 cm/s is 2.1 degree, at 50 cm/s is 1 degree, at 100 cm/s is 0.7 degree, and at 150 cm/s is 1.2 degree.

With an average Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) of 6.03 kWh/m2/day and an average wind speed of 6.3 m/s, Matakus Island is well-suited for utilizing these resources. To assess the stability of the proposed Hybrid Power Plant system, modeling is conducted using MATLAB/Simulink.

The economic analysis of the hybrid power plant is carried out using HOMER Pro, which aids in determining the overall cost-effectiveness of the system. It optimizes the configuration by considering components such as PV panels, wind turbines, batteries, and diesel generators, to find the most economically efficient setup for the hybrid power plant.

Machinery guidance, automatic steering and controlled traffic farming enable machinery to move along repeatable tracks on the field, minimizing pass-to-pass errors and overlaps. In the recent years, satellite-based navigation has also opened the door to (semi) autonomous machineries for some specific farming scenarios and operations. Farming industry is now looking to use small robots to bring efficiencies and benefits to farms, capable of complex tasks that have not been possible with traditional large-scale agricultural machinery. Even though the state-of-the-art Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers usually match the requirements posed by PA applications in open fields, propagation effects degrade the performance under foliage or with surrounding obstacles. This paper presents an experimental testbed and methodology suitable to assess the real performance of RTK GNSS-based devices in operational environments. Such testbed and methodology were effective to compare different devices, which resulted to be equivalent in open-sky conditions, but with significant differences in other types of environments.

Lee,2019,2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Summary form only given. In this paper, we propose an optical comb filter based on polarization-diversified-loop (PDL) configuration that offers switching operation between dual transmission spectra with different channel spacings by controlling the state of polarization (SOP) of input light with orthogonal relation. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the PDL-based filter consists of a four-port polarization beam splitter, combination of three half-wave plates (HWPs), one Faraday rotator (FR), and two bow-tie polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) segments with different lengths (L and 2L) and equal birefringence (B). By controlling an input polarizer located before port 1 of the PBS, ASE light is linearly polarized such as linear horizontal polarization (LHP) and linear vertical polarization (LVP) components which propagate along clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions in the PDL loop, respectively [1]. Fig. 1(b) represents principal optical paths (CW and CCW paths) divided by orthogonal SOPs of input light. Generally, when PMF segments are utilized as birefringence elements, channel spacings (Δλ) of output transmission spectra are determined by the product of their effective length (Leff) and birefringence expressed as the equation Δλ=λ2/B-Leff where λ is wavelength in vacuum. In the proposed filter, the effective length of the two PMF segments can be the sum of or difference between their two lengths according to their angular combination of the orientation angles of the three HWPs for orthogonal input SOPs. That is, by properly adjusting angle sets of the three HWPs, the proposed filter can create two sinusoidal transmittance functions with different channel spacings determined by LB and 3LB for orthogonal input SOPs of LHP and LVP, and vice versa. According to theoretical analysis, the resulting filter transmittance is the algebraic sum of two sub transmittances along the CW and CCW paths calculated by Jones matrix formulation, given by (1-a)tCW + atCCW where a is a splitting ratio of optical power coupled to x- and y-axes at the PBS and ranges from 0 to 1 for LHP and LVP input components, respectively. Fig. 1(c) shows the switching operation between dual transmission spectra with different channel spacings for orthogonal input signals at different angle set of three HWPs, measured in a wavelength range from 1548 nm to 1552 nm. In the upper figure of Fig. 1(c), two measured transmission spectra with channel spacings of ~0.75 nm and ~0.25 nm were obtained for LHP and LVP input SOPs, indicated as blue solid and red dotted lines, respectively. In a similar manner, two transmission spectra with channel spacings of ~0.25 nm and ~0.75 nm were achieved for LHP and LVP input SOPs, indicated as blue solid and red dotted lines in the lower figure of Fig. 1(c), respectively. Consequently, the fabricated filter could demonstrate the input polarization-controlled switching operation between two transmission spectra with different channel spacings of -0.25 nm and -0.75 nm without modifying the filter structure.",,,"Interdisciplinary Program of Biomedical, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; Interdisciplinary Program of Biomedical, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; Interdisciplinary Program of Biomedical, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; Interdisciplinary Program of Biomedical, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea"

An IES typically consists of a few energy generation and storage units (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines, battery banks, water tanks) that are closely interconnected. Given the distinct dynamics of the different energy generation and storage units, a centralized control scheme in general does not work well. In this work, we show how an IES can be decomposed into smaller subsystems and how distributed economic model predictive control (EMPC) can be designed based on the decomposed subsystems to optimize the operation of the IES. In the decomposition of the IES, we explore both decomposing the entire system vertically based on the time-scale multiplicity exhibited in the IES dynamics and horizontally based on the closeness of the interconnection between the various operating units. The impact of the order of applying the vertical and horizontal decomposition is also discussed. Based on the decomposed subsystems, a distributed EMPC scheme is designed. We illustrate how the features of the decomposed subsystem models can be used in the design of the local EMPCs to reduce the computational complexity and information exchange between the controllers.",,,"School of Energy and Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"

The system performance is measured by the utilization of shuttles, the utilization of lift, and the task cycle time, under various design configurations. Simulation is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the analytical model and algorithm.

Liang,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,43,"Soft robots have unique advantages over traditional rigid robots and have broad application prospects in many fields, such as pipe inspections. Several of the reported pipe-crawling soft robots have long actuation periods and small locomotion speeds. Moreover, they lack active steering property to adapt to complex piping systems, such as T-shaped pipes. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel parallel-pipe-crawling pneumatic soft robot consisting of three extensible pneumatic soft actuators and two flexible feet. The parallel structure and flexible feet allow the robot to reduce the number of steps in a crawling cycle. The extensible actuator allows the robot to change its body shape for active steering property. However, a complete mathematical model for soft robots with parallel structure is hard to establish. In this paper, the phenomenological modeling method is used to realize a mathematical model with high precision, limited calculation, and easy engineering applicability of the pipe-crawling soft robot. Then, the prototype of the robot is fabricated with the optimal structural parameters selected by finite element simulations. The static identification experiment shows that the average errors of the extended length and output force are 0.51 mm and 0.28 N, respectively. The crawling experiments in various scenarios show that the horizontal crawling speed is higher than 15 mm/s, the maximum load is 2.456 kg, and the minimum turning radius is 38.2 mm.

SRP allows the detector to iteratively self-learn the optimal thresholds, and use the thresholds to refine high-quality rotation pseudo-labels for retraining the model. SRP is optional.

Buoyancy-controlled vehicles, which control their vertical position in the water column through internal actuation but have no means of horizontal propulsion, offer an affordable and reliable platform for such in-situ data collection. However, reaching the grounding zone requires vehicles to traverse tens of kilometers under the ice shelf, with approximate position knowledge and no means of communication, in highly variable and uncertain ocean currents. To address this challenge, we propose a partially observable MDP approach that exploits model-based knowledge of the under-ice currents and, critically, of their uncertainty, to synthesize effective guidance policies. The approach uses approximate dynamic programming to model uncertainty in the currents, and QMDP to address localization uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that the policy can deliver up to 88.8% of underwater vehicles to the grounding zone – a 33% improvement compared to state-of-the-art guidance techniques, and a 262% improvement over uncontrolled drifters. Collectively, these results show that model-based under-ice guidance is a highly promising technique for exploration of under-ice cavities, and has the potential to enable cost-effective and scalable access to these challenging and rarely observed environments.",,,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"

1521,Multi-Objective Aircraft Robust Trajectory Optimization Considering Various Predictability Metrics Under Uncertain Wind,Z. Chang; M. Hu; Y. Zhang,2023,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,0,"Trajectory uncertainty presents a major challenge for air traffic management. In order to improving the predictability of flights to facilitate air traffic management while also considering the economic benefits of airlines, in this paper, a trajectory multi-objective optimization method based on robust optimal control with flexible chosen horizontal route is proposed. Both the trajectory predictability and trajectory economic cost are taken as the optimization objectives. The method takes the ensemble weather forecast data as input to consider the impact of wind uncertainty on trajectory operation. To consider the accumulated predictability of arrival time at important sampling points throughout the entire trajectory and the impacts of increased predictability on the passed through sectors with different busyness levels, the concept of robustness coefficient based on sector busyness weighting is proposed and new trajectory predictability objective functions are established. A scenario from Hong Kong to Amsterdam is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the proposed method can improve the predictability of the arrival time at the destination by 67.30% when compared with the initial flight plan, and can further improve the accumulated predictability for the entire trajectory predictability by 21.30% using the entire trajectory predictability metric as the objective. The robustness coefficient’s effect on improving the arrival time predictability for busy sectors traversed by the trajectory without bringing unacceptable costs to the trajectory predictability in other sectors is also verified.

This paper proposes a jerk-continuous feedrate smoothing (JCFS) method to generate a low-vibration and smooth feedrate profile for non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) interpolation. Firstly, the segmentation concept is introduced to subdivide the entire trajectory into segments to accommodate curvature changes of the NURBS curve, accelerating the acceleration/deceleration process. Secondly, a length threshold-based curve segment classification method is proposed to overcome the complexity of the traditional acceleration and deceleration algorithms. The curve segments are divided into long, medium, and short types, and the length threshold calculation model is derived. Next, to avoid computational complexity for engineering applications, a model is established for the first time to calculate the actual maximum feedrate for different types of segments. Finally, the horizontal-8-shaped and butterfly-shaped NURBS curves are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the machining quality is steadily improved while several key indicators remain within the given tolerances.

Accurate identification and real-time monitoring of flow status are conducive to the in-depth study of two-phase flow and the safe operation of industrial process. A monitoring strategy based on sparse local Fisher discriminant analysis (SLFDA) is proposed in this article. First, multisensor signals are obtained to reflect flow process information.

Then, the weight coefficient matrixes of SLFDA keep the original structure of the same flow status data and make the data of different flow statuses more separated, which distinguish different flow statuses to the maximum extent. Finally, two monitoring indexes including the discriminant index and the stability index are established to analyze the dynamic flow process, which enable a concurrent monitoring of both flow evolution and instability to realize fine-scale description of flow process. SLFDA can monitor various flow statuses through only one projection discriminant matrix by transforming high-dimensional signals into features representing the flow characteristics, which avoids model traversal and improves monitoring efficiency.

Range of Motion (ROM) is a very effective marker reflecting the health of affected joints and is estimated by orthopaedicians usually by performing manual measurements using a goniometer which is both inconvenient and lack the ability to peform an accurate, real time analysis of the full rotational movement. Motion sensors embedded in wearables have been researched successfully for ROM estimation, but not without some drawbacks which hinder their practical use in a medical scenario, which include need of multiple wearable sensors, low accuracy while estimating ROM in a horizontal plane, and questionable accuracy at extremely slow rotational speeds. This work proposes ‘ROMeasure’, a wearable-based ROM estimation solution which aims to address the above shortcomings. We discuss a novel approach using a single wrist-wearable leveraging the relative invariance in axis of rotation during ROM measurement using gyroscope sensor present onboard the wearable. We demonstrate our solution’s accuracy by performing different ROM rotations for elbow and shoulder joints using a smartwatch, with an angle-graduated board and goniometer as sources of ground truth measurement.

Wang,2020,2020 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT,IEEE Conferences,2,"Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development is increasing dramatically. To reach the full potential of UAV, the requirement of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) performance is increasing for UAV applications. However, the accuracy and reliability of GNSS are always affected by interference such as multipath effects in some special environments, which may deteriorate the safety of general and civil aviation operations. It is therefore essential to enable an effectively GNSS fault detection scheme to make sure the high accuracy of UAV positioning calculation. In this paper, we have proposed a new historical data based GNSS fault detection and exclusion algorithm for UAV positioning. The proposed algorithm enables a real-time online dataset based fault detection and exclusion scheme, which allows accurate detection of simultaneous multiple faults of different satellites for real-time GNSS measurement quality control in dynamic positioning applications. The UAV flight tests with fault satellites of various pseudorange errors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with a fault detection rate of 100% for the multi-satellite faults scenario. With fault detection and exclusion, the horizontal and 3D positioning accuracy RMSE is greatly improved to 1. 01m and 6. 73m, respectively, while the accuracy could be tens of meters (horizontal) and more than 100 meters (3D) before fault satellite exclusion.",GNSS;UAV positioning;fault detection and exclusion,,"College of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"

In this work, we describe a system to assist walking in a simpler way than exoskeletons by providing linear impulses directly at the COM instead of providing torques at the joints. We developed a novel waist end-effector and high-level controller for an existing cable-robot. The controller allows for the application of cyclic horizontal force profiles with desired magnitudes, timings, and durations based on detection of the step timing. By selecting a lightweight rubber series elastic element with optimal stiffness and carefully tuning the gains of the closed-loop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller in a number of single-subject experiments, we were able to reduce the within-step root mean square error between desired and actual forces up to 1.21% of body weight. This level of error is similar or lower compared to the performance of other robotic tethers designed to provide variable or constant forces at the COM. The system can produce force profiles with peaks of up to 15 ± 2% of body weight within a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.5% body weight.

The array consists of  $5\times $  5 cylindrical Nd–Fe–B magnets driven by servo motors. To maximize the transmitting magnetic moment, the motors are controlled to rotate synchronously through network communication. The design of the magnet and array configuration is implemented by analyzing the torque and magnetic moment. Magnetic forces between the array magnets are analyzed by using the equivalent static magnetic dipole model. Permalloy sleeves are used to reduce the influence of magnetic force on the synchronization of magnets. The total transmitting magnetic moment of the RPMA is 360 A  $\cdot ~\text{m}^{2}$ , and its power efficiency is 14.4 times higher than the conventional transmitting system using coils.

The localization problem is a major challenge. Among the different proposals for localization, the beamforming algorithms have proved to be a reliable option. However, they present some limitations. The beamforming algortihms have two sources of errors: (i) the noise typical of sensors and signals and (ii) the arrangement of the sensors, which is a function of the true azimuth (horizontal angle from an observer - the AUV - to the object of interest) and elevation angles. Therefore, the beamforming has an error factor which is the sum of both errors described.

The parameters in the model are usually fixed; however, biology shows that animals change their leg stiffness according to the locomotion velocity, and this adaptability invariably affects the stability of the gait. This paper provides an analysis of the influence of this variable leg stiffness on the stability of different quadrupedal gaits. The analysis exploits a simplified quadrupedal model with compliant legs and shoulder joints represented as torsional springs. This model can reproduce the most common quadrupedal gaits observed in nature. The stability of such emerging gaits is then checked. Afterward, an optimization process is used to search for the system parameters that guarantee maximum gait stability. Our study shows that using the highest feasible leg swing frequency and adopting a leg stiffness that increases with the speed of locomotion noticeably improves the gait stability over a wide range of horizontal velocities while reducing the oscillations of the trunk.

Robotic limbs can support a heavy backpack when standing still, but accelerating a backpack within a couple of steps to race-walking speeds requires limb force and energy beyond natural human ability. Here, we conceive a human-driven robot exoskeleton that could accelerate a heavy backpack faster and maintain top speeds higher than what the human alone can when not carrying a backpack. The key components of the exoskeleton are the mechanically adaptive but energetically passive spring limbs. We show that by optimally adapting the stiffness of the limbs, the robot can achieve near-horizontal center of mass motion to emulate the load-bearing mechanics of the bicycle. We find that such an exoskeleton could enable the human to accelerate one extra body weight up to top race-walking speeds in ten steps.

Dong,2023,IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,IEEE Journals,0,"The theory, design, and verification of a novel miniaturized reconfigurable Huygens antenna with 360° continuous beam-scanning capability are demonstrated in this article. Different from the conventional Huygens topology, both the monopole-like Huygens form and the metamaterial loading technique are explored for size reduction. By creatively tuning the direction (or polarization) of the electric dipole (E-dipole) or magnetic dipole (M-dipole), a novel miniaturized pattern reconfigurable Huygens source is first proposed. Then, to control the polarization of the M-dipole [linearly polarized (LP)], a double circularly polarized (CP) wave with a tunable phase difference is introduced.

1553,Proposal of Period Modulation Control of Wearable Cyborg HAL Trunk-Unit for Parkinson's Disease/Parkinsonism Utilizing Motor Intention and Dynamics,A. Uehara; H. Kawamoto; Y. Sankai,2023,2023 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII),IEEE Conferences,0,"Parkinsonism is a movement disorder associated with Parkinson's disease, and the progression of this causative disease makes standing and walking difficult. These disorders are type of ataxia primarily due to a loss of motor coordination in the central nervous system (CNS). The ability to walk independently varies with intraday or daily variation and the severity of the disease. Therefore, voluntary motor commands to move skeletal muscles are output from the CNS, as well as whole-body dynamics such as joint movements of the lower limbs and center of gravity (COG) shifts associated with gait. For these reason, treatment and improvement of gait independence for gait disorders in Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism patients could be provided by a wearable cyborg which is synchronized with the lateral sway involving patient's gait in order to construct proper interactive Bio-Feedback (iBF) loop. To synchronize gait, which is a cyclic motion, with a wearable cyborg HAL trunk-unit, we developed a control method that dynamically changes parameters related to periodic force based on motion intention and dynamics. In the HAL, the power unit fixed at the waist transmits periodic force to the chest via a link, thereby exerting horizontal force on the COG of the upper body, which is located near the wearer's chest. The power unit is controlled by calculating and changing the period of cyclic output torque by sequentially applying the least-squares method, in which the fitting function is a trigonometric function, to the time series data of the bio-electrical signals (BES), which reflects the intention to move, and the ground reaction force (GRF), which reflects the dynamics and posture. As a result of a gait experiment with an able-bodied person, the time for the torque to reach zero based on the inflection point of the center of pressure (COP) position was −0.08 ± 0.13 s. The result suggests that the HAL can be synchronized with the wearer by period modulation for cyclic output torque based on motor intention and dynamics of the wearer.",,,"Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"

However, these dampers have the disadvantage that the entire system with pendulum and damper is a technically complex and expensive construction. One alternative is the Tuned Liquid Sloshing Damper (TLSD). The advantage of the lower technical effort is offset by the disadvantages of non-adjustable damping and wave breaking at large deflections. To increase the effectiveness, it is necessary to further develop the TLSD so that the degree of damping can be precisely adjusted and the non-linear behaviour can be avoided. This can be optimised as follows: Floating particles on the liquid surface ensure that energy is extracted from the system and the sloshing movements of the liquid through internal friction and wall friction subside more quickly. The quantity of particles and other parameters can be used to adjust the level of damping. The surface of the fluid-particle filling can be forced to move almost linearly with an additional lightweight rigid plate placed above the particles.

The proposed alignment technique also provides secure 2-dimensional (2-D) operation of each polarization without performance degradation. In addition, dummy patterns are designed and added between each unit cell for a wide scanning range. The 180° phase difference can be maintained for the wider incident and reflected angles by the dummy patterns. Furthermore, a RIS prototype that includes a 40 × 40 array of dual-polarized unit cells, an Arduino microcontroller, and a DCDC converter is designed and fabricated. The measurement is performed using a customized antenna holder that helps to accurately measure the 2-D spherical coordinate while changing the reflected angle from −30° to +30° with a 5° interval.

Zhu,2023,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,0,"Human drivers have excellent perception and reaction abilities in complex environments such as dangerous highways, busy intersections, and harsh weather conditions. To achieve human-level driving performance, autonomous driving systems require powerful environmental perception systems and the ability to make accurate decisions in difficult situations, enabling vehicles to maintain smooth driving. However, making decisions based on visual perception is still a daunting challenge for autonomous vehicles, also current end-to-end networks and modular frameworks have limitations in effectively addressing perception, decision-making, and control, such as a lack of interpretability and weak generalization ability in complex environments. This paper proposes an elaborate modular pipeline for autonomous driving that effectively integrates semantic perception information, multi-level decision tasks, and control modules. The decision-making module comprehensively considers high-level maneuver selection and low-level motion control in both horizontal and vertical directions. The proposed MP framework is trained end-to-end by a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning method with a new action sampling mechanism. To adapt to the experimental scenarios, we use the CARLA simulation platform to collect data to evaluate the proposed autonomous driving framework and its new training method, considering various environmental factors such as sunny, dusk, and rainy weather. The results show that the framework exhibits smooth and effective driving strategies in different environments and can converge quickly and stably. The method improves learning efficiency and reduces unnecessary coupling and error propagation. Overall, the proposed framework and training method provide new ideas for improving existing autonomous driving systems.",Autonomous driving;CARLA;deep reinforcement learning;hierarchical reinforcement learning,,"College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"

Ohashi,2022,IECON 2022 – 48th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society,IEEE Conferences,0,"Magnetic levitation in general is relevant to applications which require fine control of motion, vibration, force and torque. One common method for magnetic levitation is to use four iron core coils connected in pairs, two Hall effect sensors, and an outer ring of permanent magnets to levitate disk magnets from below. This method uses only two feedback control loops to stabilize rotation and translation of the magnet together in both horizontal directions, where vertical translation is passively stable and its vertical axis yaw rotation is left uncontrolled to rotate freely. The advantageous features of this levitation configuration is that only two sensors and actuators are needed to levitate a magnet above an array of coils.To investigate the characteristics of this magnetic levitation method, we have modeled the forces and torques produced on the levitated magnet from the fixed magnets and induced magnetization of the coil cores according to its position and orientation. This model will enable modification of the system design parameters to optimize performance in terms of levitated weight, height, stability or any other desired criteria of the levitation system.

Wang,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,5,"Motivated by the problem that water-track Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) cannot effectively suppress the error accumulation of strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS), this paper proposes a novel SINS/DVL integrated navigation algorithm for deep and long cruising range Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV). Such algorithm decomposes the navigation process into two tightly coupled working modes: alignment mode and navigation mode. In the alignment mode, HOV is controlled to perform horizontal circular motion for several minutes to realize Self-Aided SINS. Combining the precise navigation solutions provided by Self-Aided SINS and measurements from DVL with water track, recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is adopted to estimate heading misalignment angle between SINS and DVL and horizontal ocean current velocity. In the navigation mode, both horizontal ocean current velocity obtained in the alignment mode and DVL measurements are utilized to assist SINS, thus enabling SINS/DVL/Current integrated navigation. A square trajectory with a navigation-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) is simulated to evaluate the proposed SINS/DVL integrated navigation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed SINS/DVL integrated navigation is capable of suppressing SINS error divergence effectively and efficiently.

1563,Robust Correction of Relative Geometric Errors Among GaoFen-7 Regional Stereo Images Based on Posteriori Compensation,Y. Pi; B. Yang; X. Li; M. Wang,2022,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,0,"Correcting the relative geometric errors is an essential step in the generation of digital ortho maps and digital surface models from GaoFen-7 (GF-7) regional images, in which the block adjustment (BA) technology is always adopted. However, the traditional BA methods are typically ineffective and not universal due to their dependence on sufficient control data. Although recently developed BA methods using a large number of observation images can substantially eliminate the additional control data, they are not suitable for the BA with few images in the absence of sufficient control data, which is a situation that is often encountered in practical applications. In such situation, the inevitable elevation error caused by the initial positioning error of images will transfer and accumulate in the horizontal direction of the block, resulting in the inconsistent geometric accuracies among images. Aiming at this problem, this article proposed a practical method of combining a stable free BA and a posteriori compensation. Through the stepwise correction and integration of geometric errors, the elevation error and its cumulative effect in free BA could be eliminated at a small control cost, and a robust result with consistent accuracy could be achieved, even with only a few observation images. This method was validated through experiments performed on GF-7 stereo images, and the satisfactory results indicated that it effectively restrained error accumulation and improved the geo-positioning consistency of regional GF-7 images.",Elevation error;free block adjustment (BA);GaoFen-7 (GF-7) regional images;posteriori compensation;relative geometric error,,"State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, and School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, and School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, and School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, and School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"

The system consists of a 12” Aluminum square heat source unit with 28 embedded 1800 W cartridge heaters. An external high-pressure air tank provides the system with spraying pressures ranging from 500 to 3000 Psi. User-defined control algorithms command four piezoelectric actuated injectors allowing for the manipulation of the spray frequency, duration, duty cycle, and coordination between multiple piezo-injectors. Thus far, experiments in the horizontal configuration have shown that at 60°C, surface temperatures for all heat fluxes prove difficult to control. At 90°C, however, successful results show that heat fluxes of 1.86 W/cm2 and 2.79 W/cm2 are sustainable. Conducting experiments at aggressive power loads and surface temperatures significantly below saturation intro-duce spray-pooling, coolant pools which inhibit the evaporation rate, significantly diminishing the spray cooling efficiency. To counteract this effect, additional experiments were performed in a vertical configuration to avoid the pooling of non-evaporated coolant and enhance the heat transfer through the falling film.

Barannik,2019,2019 International Multi-Conference on Industrial Engineering and Modern Technologies (FarEastCon),IEEE Conferences,0,"One of electromagnetic (EM) sounding techniques for investigating the distribution of electrical conductivity with depth to determine the geological structure of the Earth's interior is a controlled-source method (CSEM). The depth of investigation and a source-receiver separation for CSEM sounding with a horizontal electric dipole source are dependent on its length and on the value of current through it. From this point of view, a-grounded at the ends overhead power transmission line (OHL) can be successfully used for deep CSEM soundings. Since, zero-sequence impedance value of an OHL in a frequency range from 0.01 to 10 Hz is small, e.g. a few ohms for more than a hundred kilometers long OHL, then a current source, i.e. a transmitter, of sufficient power is able to provide the amplitude of the current through an OHL of several hundred amperes. Therefore, the use of an OHL for deep CSEM soundings allows to increase a transmitter-receiver separation up to 1000 km and to reach a depth of investigation of 80-100 km. CSEM soundings effectiveness is influenced by a transmitter's design and characteristics. Main requirements for the design of transmitters for deep CSEM soundings by using an OHL were discussed. The transmitters of 200, 30 and 2 kW power were developed. The ability to generate an arbitrary waveform, with controlled amplitude, shape, and frequency, is a main distinctive feature of the transmitters.

1568,A Quantitative Approach for Estimating the Scaling Thresholds and Step Policies in a Distributed Microservice Architecture,C. K. Rudrabhatla,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,3,"Microservice architecture (MSA) has become a de facto standard for developing complex web applications lately. Horizontal scalability, domain isolation, agility and the provision to use heterogenous technologies are some of the key factors for the growing popularity of this architecture. To automatically cater to varying load patterns, quite a lot of advancements have been made in the field of cloud computing, containerization and orchestrating mechanisms which aid to perform the auto scaling of the microservices. However, setting up the scaling policies, optimal upper and lower thresholds is a daunting task for large applications. It generally involves some initial guess work followed by multiple rounds of tuning based on the real time load variations. This process causes situations where either the service becomes unavailable to the load when the thresholds are on the lower side, (or) underutilization of the compute resources when they are on higher side. This paper aims to find a quantitative way of determining the thresholds and step-up policies by deducing the mathematical formulas. To solve this formidable problem, we propose a model in which the total resource consumption of a container running in the peak load scenario can be calculated by - (1) first identifying the critical transactions and their maximum concurrency rates,(2) then calculating the resource consumption of such transactions in a controlled environment and (3) finally applying those values to the mathematical formulas based on Gaussian functions to calculate the total resource consumption for the peak load scenario. Using the total resource consumption value and considering the network and startup latencies, an optimal upper threshold value for step-up functions can be calculated. In this paper, we calculated the upper threshold values using the above-mentioned approach and verified using a research project that the calculated value is indeed the minimum number of containers to handle load.",Microservices;cloud computing;orchestration;containerization;auto scaling;thresholds;step policies;Gaussian distribution;horizontal scaling,,"Sony Pictures Entertainment, Los Angeles, CA, USA"

In this work, we use a low thermal budget process to fabricate and characterize both horizontal and vertical V02 devices. In both configurations, V02 devices show voltage induced reversible switching beyond a threshold voltage. The threshold voltage of devices decreases monotonically as a function of decreasing channel length of the devices. The vertical device shows the lowest threshold voltage compared to the horizontal structure due to significantly smaller channel length. Finally, we demonstrate a relaxation oscillator using the fabricated V02 devices which shows stable oscillations over half a million cycles with an oscillation frequency of 1.75 kHz.

Xu,2020,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,IEEE Journals,29,"This paper studies a secrecy unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with coordinated multi-point (CoMP) reception, in which one UAV sends confidential messages to a set of cooperative ground receivers (GRs), in the presence of several suspicious eavesdroppers. In particular, we consider two types of eavesdroppers that are non-colluding and colluding, respectively. Under this setup, we exploit the UAV's maneuver in three dimensional (3D) space together with transmit power adaptation for optimizing the secrecy communication performance. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, in which the UAV is placed at a fixed but optimizable location during the communication period. In this scenario, we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D placement and transmit power control to maximize the secrecy rate. Under both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers, we obtain the optimal solutions to the joint 3D placement and transmit power control problems in well structures. Next, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, in which the UAV has a mission to fly from an initial location to a final location during the communication period. In this scenario, we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D trajectory and transmit power allocation to maximize the average secrecy rate during the whole communication period. To deal with the difficult joint 3D trajectory and transmit power allocation problems, we present alternating-optimization-based approaches to obtain high-quality solutions. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the performance of our proposed designs. It is shown that due to the consideration of CoMP reception, our proposed design with 3D maneuver significantly outperforms the conventional design with two dimensional (2D) (horizontal) maneuver only, by exploiting the additional degrees of freedom in altitudes. It is also shown that the non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers lead to distinct 3D UAV maneuver behaviors, e.g., under colluding eavesdroppers, the UAV should fly farther apart from them (than that under the non-colluding ones) for avoiding their collaborative interception.",UAV communications;physical layer security;coordinated multi-point (CoMP) reception;3D maneuver;power adaptation,,"School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNII), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"

For this study, we estimate the vertical current velocity from anomalies in the vertical ascent and descent rates of two Slocum ocean buoyancy glider missions in the northern Gulf of Mexico in fall 2015. The vertical current velocity estimates are related to mixing processes of the open ocean. The gliders collected upper ocean (surface to 1000m; 1 Hz sampling, vertical and horizontal velocities ~20 cm/s) data, e.g., CTD, fluorometer, dissolved oxygen.

Vertical sections of estimated vertical water velocity shows coherent horizontal structure aligned with the density gradients at the base of the Loop Current velocity core and intensification between the eddies, likely the result of internal wave generation.

To obtain higher resolution density results by the joint inversion of large-scale gravity and its gradient, we propose a density-weighted and cross-gradient constrained (DWCG) joint inversion method in the sphere coordinate, which improves the inversion accuracy by introducing a density structural constraint provided by the gravity inversion result. Furthermore, the block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block (BTTB) structure is used to finish the DWCG joint inversion, which effectively accomplishes a high-efficiency calculation and is more practical for performing the inversion of large-scale data. Theoretical modeling experiments show that the DWCG joint inversion method can effectively improve the resolution and identify the distribution of deep and shallow field sources, and the accuracy is improved by nearly 40% compared to the regularization inversion method of gravity data. Simultaneously, the DWCG joint inversion method has certain noise immunity. Finally, we apply the DWCG joint inversion method to the lunar data to obtain the density distribution and further revealed the Moho relief by nonlinear inversion based on the density results.

In this work deep reinforcement learning algorithms are combined with a domain randomization method to learn robust wind-resistant hovering policies. A novel reward function is designed to guide learning. This reward function uses a constant reward to maintain a continuous flight of a UAV as well as a weight of the horizontal distance error to ensure the stability of the UAV at altitude. A five-dimensional representation of actions instead of the traditional four dimensions is designed to strengthen the coordination of wings of a UAV.

Sasaki,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,3,"A light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) system is an important means that takes an omni-directional view to collect precise surrounding 3D information in high sampling frequency. However, due to the architecture of a LiDAR sensor, LiDAR data typically contains much less information in the vertical direction compared to the horizontal direction. In addition, LiDAR data are often defected during measurement. There have been previous researches about LiDAR data interpolation using a high-resolution reference image. However, they suffer from the calibration error due to vibration or shock during operation and do not consider defected data. Here, we propose a reference-free interpolation method with considering the defected LiDAR data using a two-step network architecture. Our proposed method is designed first to exploit the rich information in the horizontal direction of the LiDAR data to restore the defected data and then increase the vertical resolution of LiDAR data. Since the proposed interpolation method is a reference-free approach, it if free from the calibration issue. We confirm that our proposed method shows better performance than existing interpolation methods and is effective as a pre-processing function in other applications. For example, our proposed method can improve the performance of the human segmentation. We also propose a pixelwise dynamic convolution layer as a component of the proposed interpolation method.

Furthermore, the acquisition accuracy of back EMF is limited by the resistance tolerance of measurement circuit. Inaccurate acquisition of back EMF will result in vertical deviation of the envelopes. These two nonideal factors decrease the commutation accuracy and deteriorate the control performance. In order to suppress the commutation errors, an adaptive threshold correction strategy, including horizontal and vertical corrections is proposed for eliminating the influence of these two nonideal factors, respectively.

Two orthogonally polarized slotted waveguide antennas (SWAs) are cross-placed as the main radiator, which is designed based on ridged waveguides (RGWs) to reduce the width of the waveguides and obtain a wider steering range. The two SWAs are fed by two pillbox reflector beamforming networks (BFNs), and a special impedance transition is designed to reduce the reflection between the quasi-TEM wave in the parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) to the TE10 wave. By exciting different feeding patches in the focal planes of the pillbox reflectors, the SWA achieves different beams. In order to further increase the crossover level, the single-port excitation (SPE) and the dual-port excitation (DPE) method are used together to increase the equivalent source number in the compact area of the focal plane. Besides, the DPE method can also reduce the sidelobe level (SLL) of the beams excited by the side ports.

We aim to minimize UAV swarm energy consumption subject to numerous constraints. To tackle the challenging formulated problem, we decompose the original challenging problem into a list of sub-problems according to block coordinate descent (BCD) method and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve subproblems in an iterative manner. Specifically, the optimization of USVs offloading decisions is formulated as mixed-integer non-linear programming and then a modified deferred acceptance algorithm is proposed. The joint consideration of UAVs flight speed and UAV swarm stability is converted into a single-objective optimization problem after determining UAV control system’s latency requirements, and then Lagrangian multiplier method with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is proposed. Successive convex approximations (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to convert the non-convex constraints to convex ones, and then UAVs hovering coordinates can be obtained by solving the convex approximation problem. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of jointly considering USVs offloading decisions, UAVs flight speed, UAVs horizontal hovering coordinates and the number of UAVs for energy efficiency in comparison with several advanced baseline algorithms without optimization design.",MEC;UAV;USV;IoT;time windows,,"School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"

Ma,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,1,"The identification of coherent clusters plays an important role in dynamic equivalence and active split control of power systems. The existing coherent clustering methods often adopt a single indicator, e.g. only based on the power angle curve to identify coherent clusters. In addition, in the coherency identification process, the feature extraction is not sufficient, which may cause the problem of inaccurate grouping. In this paper, a coherent clustering method based on weighted clustering of multi-indicator panel data (WCMPD) is proposed. First, the measurements including power angle increment, terminal voltage, and rotor kinetic energy increment from phasor measurement units (PMU) are selected from panel data to reflect the coherence of the generators. Second, the indicator weights and time weights are calculated based on the cross-sectional and time dimension of the panel data. In order to suppress the shortcomings of the coherent clustering method based on Euclidean distance, three distance functions (“horizontal absolute value,” “rate of change at adjacent time points,” and “fluctuation variation degree”) are defined, and then aggregated. At last, the distance matrices among generators are calculated and the coherent generators can be obtained based on the system cluster method. The simulation results on the EPRI-36 bus system and the North China power grid demonstrate that the proposed method has better clustering results than traditional methods.",Coherency clustering;weighted clustering algorithm of panel data;multiple indicator;index weight;system clustering,,"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Xinjiang Electric Power Corporation Economic and Technological Research Institute, Ürümqi, China; State Grid Economic and Technological Research Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing, China; State Grid Economic and Technological Research Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing, China; State Grid Economic and Technological Research Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing, China; Sichuan Electric Power Corporation Economic and Technological Research Institute, Chengdu, China; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

However, due to complex working environment on site, the accuracy of cuttings flow rate monitoring is low. In order to solve this problem, based on the analysis of a cuttings flow rate real-time measurement method, combined with the classic Kalman filter (KF) algorithm, an adaptive KF model based on fuzzy control rules (Fuzzy-KF) is proposed, it realize real-time update of process noise  $({Q})$  and measurement noise  $({R})$  and realize real-time correction of data collected by sensors of Cuttings Flow Meters (CFM).

Recently, microservices architectures have garnered the attention of many organizations-providing higher levels of scalability, availability, and fault isolation. Many organizations choose to host their microservices architectures in cloud data centres to offset costs. Incidentally, data centres become over-encumbered during peak usage hours and underutilized during off-peak hours. Traditional microservice scaling methods perform either horizontal or vertical scaling exclusively. When used in combination, however, these methods offer complementary benefits and compensate for each other's deficiencies. To leverage the high availability of horizontal scaling and the fine-grained resource control of vertical scaling, we developed two novel hybrid autoscaling algorithms and a dedicated network scaling algorithm and benchmarked them against Google's popular Kubernetes horizontal autoscaling algorithm. Results indicated up to 1.49x speedups in response times for our hybrid algorithms, and 1.69x speedups for our network algorithm under high-burst network loads.","Docker, microservices, autoscaling, cloud",,"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Thomas J.

Jamal,2020,"2020 International Conference on Electrical, Communication, and Computer Engineering (ICECCE)",IEEE Conferences,0,"Statistics show that almost 10% of the total road accidents are because of the rollover of heavy-duty tankers. The probability of rollover is higher in partially filled tankers than the filled tankers. The higher tendency of rollover accidents in partially filled tankers is because of the liquid sloshing inside the tankers. This rollover inside the tanker results in the dynamic instability of the tanker. The rollover stability is sensitive to the shape of the tanker, the properties of the fluid inside the tanker, the fill level of the tanker and the location of the baffles inside the tanker. The baffles and active rollover control system can be used to overcome the dynamic instability of the heavy-duty tankers. Active control system can limit the dynamic shifting of Center of Gravity (C.G). Baffles on the other hand found to be more effective in terms of minimizing the dynamic moments and forces on the tanker's wall. Different baffle configurations can be used to reduce the liquid sloshing effect. However, this research is mainly focus on determining the effect of different locations of horizontal baffles for different fill level of an elliptical tank.

The present frequency bands reach their capacity limit and consider below the customer's demands particularly when thinking about the new upcoming technologies such as IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies. In this work, we investigate propagation characteristics of the radio channel in 7 and 23 GHz as a part of the new super-high frequency (SHF) band which is expecting to operate for wireless control and particularly above the seawater surface that is considered an unusual environment from the link connection point of view. The two frequency bands were selected based on their utilization in various link budgets to cover the effect of frequency in terms of different wireless conceptual such as constructive and destructive Interference behavior in addition to the vertical and horizontal polarization. The result shows that the 23 GHz is severely affected by the path loss propagation with extremely high variation in constructive and destructive interferences which could be accommodated when using space diversity technology.

Aiming at solving these problems, the current study proposes and designs a grinding- polishing coalesced giant robot to achieve high-precision in efficient grinding and polishing operation. One of the technical difficulties is “to operate in precision meanwhile to move in stability” for the robot. AGV guidance and Ackermann steering system provide an accurate, reliable, and stable position and gesture for the tool head. Based on machine vision and the parameters of the horizontal line of the blade as the basic navigation information, specified reference points are accurately located and possible static objects are literally spotted for auxiliary reference points between the blade and the robot, making the vehicle move from the start, through the intermediate operation, to job completion according to the rational threshold value in the design.

The time is hard to be significantly shortened using the traditional methods because initial alignment and spacecraft erection must be fulfilled in order. To solve the problem, an estimation and correction method for azimuth and attitude errors of attitude tracking is proposed in this article. We propose a real-time error estimation model to reveal the effect of the initial azimuth, attitude errors, and the gyro biases of the spacecraft inertial measurement unit (SIMU) on the current azimuth and attitude errors during attitude tracking, making it possible to post-compensate the initial coarse azimuth error and the gyro biases of the SIMU at the end of attitude tracking. This model is the key and the theoretical basis of our proposed method. Detailed estimation and correction steps are designed, to achieve the purpose of fulfilling the spacecraft erection and the fine-alignment of the vehicular inertial measurement unit (VIMU) in parallel. The results of the simulations and experiments show that the preparation time is remarkably shortened using the proposed method, without decreasing the final azimuth and attitude accuracy of the SIMU. This proposed method detaches the inherent viewpoint that fine-alignment must be completed before attitude tracking and spacecraft erection in the traditional horizontal collimation scheme.

First, both the finite element (FE) and force analysis of the RNMST model were analyzed and studied under different velocity and different class of road surfaces. The three types of tire models, nonlinear single-spring tire (NSST) model, nonlinear multi-spring tire model and RNMST model, were introduced as the vehicle tire devices for a quarter vehicle models into nonlinear cooperative bridge-vehicle system. The cooperative dynamics problem, alongside separation and the responses of road surface in terms of its uneven nature, is a typical dynamics problem with the nonlinearity of material which can be solved using the Newmark- $\beta $  method. The comparison of the results demonstrated that the analysis of the dynamics of the cooperative bridge-vehicle system under the RNMST model and NMST model are generally similar. However, the radial nonlinear multi-spring-damper tire model is more accurate and closer to the stress state of the real tire model. Also, to further illustrate the comprehensive performance of the RNMST, the responses under different pavement excitations were analyzed by using the amplitude-frequency spectrum method. Finally, to research the influence dynamics of tire force on the CBV system, the horizontal component of tire force was analyzed.

As a result, various applications of this technology have emerged and affected many aspects of everyday activities. Considering the diverse areas in which drones are used, it is deemed necessary to develop legal controls over these uses in order to achieve national, regional, or international purposes. For legal regulation of drones to take place, there should be bodies or institutions in charge of the implementation of the legislation regulating drone uses, operations, and related activities, in accordance with international treaties and agreements. This paper argues that the diversity and development of the activities in which the drone is used require the establishment of legal controls to regulate its authorization including that of activities, types, designs, manufacturing, importing, selling, owning, registration, as well as protecting third party's right to data privacy and confidentiality. Drone legislation is needed to regulate issues related to compensation for damages arising from activities associated with drones, and to setting conditions, requirements, and procedures for the use of drone radio frequencies, systems, and remote control stations. Rules also have a significant role in monitoring the establishment of the infrastructure implementing the operation of these aircraft, their airports, the mechanism for supplying fuel and energy, and the issuance of an operational safety certificate.

Despite the well-known relationship between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the vestibular system ANS, involvement in PPPD has not yet been investigated. We studied HRV in fifteen patients with PPPD and fifteen healthy controls (HCs), during a virtual reality task that simulated self-motion in horizontal and vertical directions with different kinematic conditions (accelerated, decelerated, constant), to elicit vestibular stimulation via kinematic visual inputs. Subject, condition-, direction, kinematic- and trial- specific HRV indices values were compared through mixed models. In PPPD patients (as compared to HC), we observed a) lower parasympathetic tone (p<;0.001), lower variability of parasympathetic tone (p<;0.02) higher sympathovagal balance (p<;0.001). We also observed lower variability of parasympathetic tone in vertical motion as opposed to horizontal motion (p=0.03). Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PPPD, like many other psychosomatic conditions, alters the physiological regulation of the ANS. This, in turn, might impact on the processing of gravity and balance-related signal and lead to the characteristic symptoms of PPPD.

An aspect, which increases the attack surface of those devices is the trend of Industry 4.0 and the associated network interconnections. While those devices were air-gapped and communication was clearly segregated, new technologies arise, which break up with this concept, since horizontal and vertical interconnection is essential for future use cases in ICS. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) represents such a new technology, which allows the transmission of hard real-time traffic, commonly present within the field level communication, converged with other communication streams, e.g. non-time critical best-effort traffic, on the same wire. On the one hand this approach brings many benefits for ICS environments, e.g. predictive maintenance to reduce unplanned downtime, logging and others. But on the other hand this technology enlarges the attack surface of ICS and must therefore be analyzed from a cyber security perspective. For instance the transmission of real-time traffic can be disturbed easily by various network-based attacks, which makes protective measures necessary. Theretore, within this work, security considerations for the use of TSN within ICS applications are presented, suitable protective measures as well as potential enhancements are depicted.

The gravity compensation combines permanent magnets with novel hybrid shape memory actuators. The magnetically levitated system uses a homopolar linear drive as well as nine reluctance actuators to levitate a passive armature with no mechanical connection between the stator and armature. The mechanical design is based on geometrically decoupled horizontal and vertical guidance axes. A decoupled Cartesian control scheme is developed, which compensates for the actuator and system nonlinearities in order to achieve high bandwidths. The active gravity compensation adjusts the air gap between the permanent magnets and armature to the required gravity compensation force. This helps to keep the dissipated power and temperature increase in the magnetically levitated drive low (and thus, system precision high). To avoid the generation of particles in clean room applications, the actuators positioning the permanent magnets are solely based on solid-state effects: thermal shape memory alloys actively generate motion, while passive magnetic shape memory alloy elements realize a multistable behavior based on their internal twinning force. The resulting actuator is compact, energy efficient, and abrasion-free.

1638,A Wideband Polarization Reconfigurable Orthogonal-Dipole Antenna Controlled by Liquid Metal Switches,Y. Zhang; S. Lin; D. Qin; Q. Ding; X. Zhang,2023,IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"This letter proposes a novel wideband crossed-dipole antenna that utilizes liquid metal switches for polarization reconfiguration. The antenna consists of a wideband single-fed crossed bowtie dipole with each arm featuring a gradually varying width bent slot. A back cavity structure serves as a reflector to achieve directional radiation and circular polarization (CP) bandwidth enhancement. The proposed antenna uses movable liquid metal columns in microchannels as coupling switches to open or close the slots. By controlling the switches to close either the vertical or horizontal slots, the antenna achieves directional radiation of left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) or right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), respectively. When all the slots are opened or closed simultaneously, the directional radiation of linear polarization (LP) is achieved. Experimental results indicate that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 65.02% and an axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of 43.14% in the circular polarization mode, with a maximum gain of 11.6 dBic. In the linear polarization mode, the antenna exhibits an impedance bandwidth of 42.5% and a maximum gain of 11.48 dBi.

1639,An Adaptive Grid Frequency Support Mechanism for Energy Management in Cloud Data Centers,K. Kaur; S. Garg; N. Kumar; G. S. Aujla; K. -K. R. Choo; M. S. Obaidat,2020,IEEE Systems Journal,IEEE Journals,14,"Grid frequency support is one of the most challenging problems, since minor variations in it may lead to huge financial losses. This problem becomes even more challenging with the horizontal and vertical expansion of modern cloud data centers (DCs). In the past, several efforts have been made to manage frequency deviations using flywheels, commercial buildings, electric vehicles, and renewable energy resources. However, these are not adequate due to their complex operations. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose the usage of cloud DCs and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units for the effective frequency regulation. This is achieved by designing a 2-layer hierarchical control scheme for optimal segregation of the regulation signals amongst the DCs and UPS batteries. The proposed scheme determines the scheduling policy for jobs at DCs; along with the charging and discharging cycles of the UPS batteries. The job scheduling is carried out with respect to MapReduce tasks in accordance with the regulation signals with minimal service level adherence violations. Additionally, the sustainability of DCs is also supported through active participation of UPSes during peak hours. The overall frequency support problem in the considered setup involves multiple objectives under multiconstraint environment. Thus, it has been divided in two subproblems, which are addressed individually using either integer linear programming or mixed integer linear programming. In a nutshell, the proposed scheme serves dual purposes, i.e., manages frequency fluctuations and sustains DCs during peak hours. It has been validated using data traces taken from OpenCloud Hadoop cluster and Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for frequency support and DC's sustainability.",Data centers;frequency support;hierarchical control mechanism;MapReduce;uninterruptible power supply (UPS),,"Electrical Engineering Department, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec, Montréal, Canada; Electrical Engineering Department, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec, Montréal, Canada; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (Deemed to be University), Patiala, India; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Chandigarh University, Gharuan, India; Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA; King Abdullah School of Information Technology, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan"

The available range is defined as the maximal horizontal communication distance within which the round-trip delay and the overall packet loss probability can be ensured with a required probability. To exploit the macro-diversity gain of the distributed multi-antenna systems (DAS) and the array gain of the centralized multi-antenna systems (CAS), we consider a modified DAS (M-DAS), where the ground control station is equipped with the distributed access points (APs), and each AP can have multiple antennas. We then show that the available range can be maximized by judiciously optimizing the altitude of UAVs, the duration of the uplink and downlink phases, and the antenna configuration. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm that can converge to the optimal solution in DAS and CAS, and then extend it into more general M-DAS.

Hussein,2022,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,25,"To reduce interference from other wireless communications, a compact super wideband frequency diversity hexagonal shaped monopole antenna with switchable rejection band capabilities is proposed. The patch consists of hexagonal structure with an open-ended horizontal slot that divides the patch into upper and lower parts. The overall size of the proposed antenna is 36 mm  $\times\,\,36$  mm  $\times\,\,1.6$  mm on an FR-4 substrate material with a loss tangent of  $tan\delta$ = 0.02. The notch switchable features and the frequency diversity are controlled by changing the length of the resonator through alternating the state of two inserted parallel PIN diodes inside the horizontal open-ended slot. The upper part of the hexagonal patch is connected to the negative terminal of the diodes and the biasing circuit in the back layer through a conducting via. The lower part is connected to the positive terminal of the diode. When both diodes are OFF, the proposed antenna behaves as a super wideband covering a bandwidth from 3.37 GHz to 27.71 GHz. When both diodes are ON, there is a band notch and a frequency a frequency band (3.81 – 6.62 GHz) is filtered. The antenna’s radiation pattern is broadsided directional, and the efficiency is observed 92.9% and 96% for the ON and OFF cases, respectively.

1645,Monolithic vs. Microservice Architecture: A Performance and Scalability Evaluation,G. Blinowski; A. Ojdowska; A. Przybyłek,2022,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,25,"Context. Since its proclamation in 2012, microservices-based architecture has gained widespread popularity due to its advantages, such as improved availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability, as well as greater software development agility. Motivation. Yet, refactoring a monolith to microservices by smaller businesses and expecting that the migration will bring benefits similar to those reported by top global companies, such as Netflix, Amazon, eBay, and Uber, might be an illusion. Indeed, for systems that do not have thousands of concurrent users and can be scaled vertically, the benefits of such migration have not been sufficiently investigated, while the existing evidence is inconsistent. Objective. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance and scalability of monolithic and microservice architectures on a reference web application. Method. The application was implemented in four different versions, covering not only two different architectural styles (monolith vs. microservices) but also two different implementation technologies (Java vs. C#.NET). Next, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in three different deployment environments (local, Azure Spring Cloud, and Azure App Service). Findings. The key lessons learned are as follows: (1) on a single machine, a monolith performs better than its microservice-based counterpart; (2) The Java platform makes better use of powerful machines in case of computation-intensive services when compared to.NET; the technology platform effect is reversed when non-computationally intensive services are run on machines with low computational capacity; (3) vertical scaling is more cost-effective than horizontal scaling in the Azure cloud; (4) scaling out beyond a certain number of instances degrades the application performance; (5) implementation technology (either Java or C#.NET) does not have a noticeable impact on the scalability performance.",Software architecture;microservices;monolith;software measurement;benchmarking;performance;scalability;cloud computing;Azure,,"Institute of Computer Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland; Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdańsk University of Technology, Gdańsk, Poland; Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdańsk University of Technology, Gdańsk, Poland"

In this paper, we propose an information-centric collaborative Fog (ICCF) platform, empowered by a novel horizontal Fog-to-Fog layer. Specifically, the ICCF enhances sensor data processing performance by enabling horizontal data transfer in the Fog layer through connectionless name-based Fog-to-Fog data transmission. It utilizes the Fog node's distributed data processing power to achieve a satisfactory data processing performance, while communication with the Cloud is only required to report detected anomalies. Moreover, because the connectionless name-based scheme significantly reduces data connection overhead, this guarantees real-time communication and the ability of processing large-scale IoT data.

Different from prior works considering the two-dimensional (2D) horizontal trajectory design in the non-CoMP scenario, this paper additionally exploits the UAV's vertical trajectory (or altitude) control for further improving the secrecy communication performance with CoMP. In particular, we jointly optimize the three dimensional (3D) trajectory and transmit power allocation of the UAV to maximize the average secrecy rate at GNs over a particular flight period, subject to the UAV's maximum flight speed and maximum transmit power constraints. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization-based approach, which optimizes the transmit power allocation and trajectory design in an alternating manner, by convex optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively.

Aiming at a severe problem that the inertially stabilized platform becomes out of control as soon as a specified shock is posed on the base of the bumper in shock tests, analysis, and design of the 18-leg Stewart platform-based parallel support bumper are conducted in this paper. With the help of generalized coordinate definition, a kinetic model of the parallel support bumper is established, of which inertia, stiffness, and damping matrices are derived based on kinetic energy, elastic potential energy, and damping dissipation function, respectively. The stiffness matrix is subsequently calculated in detail; intensive parameter design of the 18-leg bumpers is carried out according to the principle of stiffness equality and coupled motion reduction, and the corresponding kinetics is analyzed with Laplacian transformation.

Sharma,2021,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,IEEE Journals,9,"In this work, we propose and analyze a plasmonic sensor with a three-layer waveguide structure. We consider the transverse spin-dependent shift (SDS) of the horizontal photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in the waveguide at a given wavelength (1557 nm) for a TM (transverse magnetic or p-polarized) mode. The sensor structure is analyzed in two ways. First, under the normal methods, that is, angular and intensity interrogation methods, for which the results indicate that the maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 4007.0 RIU−1 is attained for an optimum thickness ( $d_{2}=51$  nm) of the gold layer and this FOM is significantly greater than the corresponding FOM (413.7 RIU−1) reported earlier (for a 50 nm thick gold layer). Also, the average sensitivity increases from 0.0005 to 0.002°/Oe when the volume fraction of Fe3O4 particles ( $c$ ) in the magnetic fluid is increased from 1.48% to 1.93%. Correspondingly, a considerably finer value of the resolution (0.046 Oe) is obtained when the volume fraction is increased to 1.93% (compared to 0.199 Oe at 1.48%). Second way is the proposed method of PSHE, for which the analysis indicates that transverse SDS of the horizontal PSHE is the maximum for  $d_{2} = 51$  nm leads to the maximum sensitivity  $6.25 \times 10^{7}~\mu$ m/RIU for an amplified angle  $\Delta = 0.1^{\circ}$  and  $1.09 \times 10^{6}~\mu$ m/RIU for  $\Delta = 0.1$  rad in the conventional weak measurements. The corresponding finest possible resolution of magnetic field detection at 1.93% is  $1.5 \times 10^{-6}$  Oe in the conventional weak measurements for  $\Delta = 0.1^{\circ}$  and  $7.8 \times 10^{-8}$  Oe in the modified weak measurements for  $\Delta = 0.5$  rad, which are significantly finer than those existing in the related state of the art. The above resolution is also superior to those found under normal methods mentioned earlier. Furthermore, the effect of temperature (24.3 °C–60 °C) on PSHE-based magnetic field sensor’s performance is also analyzed which indicates that the proposed PSHE-based magnetic field sensor should be operated in a thermally controlled milieu.",Magnetic field;photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE);plasmon;resolution;sensitivity;sensor;thermal effects,,"Department of Physics 1, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Prayagraj, India; Department of Applied Sciences, Physics Division, National Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"

Seldom studies explore the mechanisms in three-dimensional (3D) formations-individuals swim in both horizontal and vertical planes, even though most animals perform 3D behaviour. In this letter, taking a pair of bio-inspired robotic fish as experimental physical models, we explore the energy cost of the follower when swimming close to a neighbour in 3D formations (mainly in the vertical plane). We found the cost of the follower is mainly affected by how it spatiotemporally interacts with the 3D vortices shed by the neighbour in 3D formations. A simple linear correlation was found between the spatial factor (the height difference) and temporal factor (the body phase difference) when the follower saves most energy compared to swimming alone. Preliminary flow visualisations and 3D computational fluid dynamic simulations show this is due to the structure of vortices along the span of the caudal fin's trailing edge.

Using combined actuation of pneumatic pouches and EA pads, the robot is able to roll on both horizontal and inclined surfaces as well as transit from horizontal to fully vertical surfaces.

When the acoustic ranging and positioning system are used for AUV underwater guidance, the acoustic ranging system is usually installed on AUV, and the acoustic beacon is installed on the guidance docking platform. When AUV is guided underwater, the acoustic ranging system sends an interrogation signal at the beginning of each ranging cycle. When the acoustic beacon on the guidance platform receives the interrogation signal, a reply signal is transmitted after the preset turnaround time of beacon. AUV underwater guidance has the phenomenon that acoustic signal transmission and reception are not in the same position. The conventional acoustic ranging and positioning method is based on the static target model, and the AUV motion in acoustic ranging is ignored. Simply use half of the two-way travel time as the observation value of the one-way travel time. This observation value is not equal to the one-way travel time between the beacon and the position of the AUV transmitting signal, nor the one-way travel time between the beacon and the location of the AUV receiving signal. For the approximate error of acoustic ranging observation model, theoretical derivation and simulation analysis are carried out. The influence degree and law of AUV motion on non identical position of acoustic ranging are obtained. Theoretical derivation and simulation analysis show that: The approximate error of distance measurement corresponding to the position of transmitting signal and receiving signal is equal in size and opposite in positive and negative. When the AUV speed is 1m / s, the maximum ranging error is -0.667m, and the ranging error decreases with the distance. In addition, the ranging error is proportional to the AUV velocity. When the relative horizontal position of AUV's straight track and beacon is different, the variation rule and numerical value of acoustic ranging error will not be affected. When the relative vertical position of AUV's straight track and beacon is different, the variation rule and numerical value of acoustic ranging error will not be affected. When AUV is guided from different directions, the AUV heading does not affect the variation rule and numerical value of ranging error. On the whole, the ranging error is not only proportional to the AUV speed, but also to the distance between the signal transmitting position and the beacon’s vertical line. But with the AUV approaching the underwater guidance platform, the influence is getting smaller, and the guidance accuracy is getting higher.",acoustic ranging;travel time;underwater guidance;non identical position,,"State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China; State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China; State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China; State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China; State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China; State Key Laboratory of Deep-sea Manned Vehicles, China Ship Scientific Research Center, Wuxi, China"

This article proposes a type of Rayleigh wave electromagnetic acoustic transducer, which is consisted of a racetrack coil and a group of periodic permanent magnet array with a special configuration. The configuration of PPMs in the proposed EMAT is different from that in the common sheared-horizontal wave EMATs. The magnet units are magnetization along the width direction. The racetrack coil generates eddy current, and the periodic permanent magnet array provides bias static magnetic fields. The directions of generated Lorentz forces depend on the relative position between the magnet units and the conductors. The center frequency of the generated guided waves depends on the distance between the adjacent magnet units.

Directional drilling has some advantages over vertical drilling though it is more expensive. In drilling engineering, the optimization of wellbore plays an important role, which can be optimized based on minimization of length, mud pressure, critical pressure, etc. Till today so many approaches and methods are used to optimize this wellbore trajectory. From those methods in this study, we have focused on metaheuristic approaches based on PSO (particle swarm optimization) which will be used to optimize wellbore trajectory. This reduction of the wellbore length helps in establishing cost-effective approaches that can be utilized to resolve a group of complex trajectory optimization challenges.

The existing ultrasonic attenuation methods are based on homogeneous media for the determination of phase fraction without considering the effect of inhomogeneity on attenuation. In this article, the fractal approach is introduced to modify the acoustic attenuation model by characterizing the inhomogeneity of the dispersed phase in pipe flow, which establishes the relationship between multi-frequency attenuation and droplet size distribution. Then, an improved covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) based on the established attenuation model is proposed to estimate oil volume fraction, which combines restart strategy with local search strategy to enhance the search performance and avoid falling into local optimum. Moreover, a demodulation method based on swept-frequency chirp is designed for the time-varying dispersed oil–water pipe flow to quickly obtain the multi-frequency attenuation. The effectiveness of the fractal-based modified attenuation model and the improved CMA-ES is verified by numerical simulations and flowing experiments.

The fabrication time of actuators can be significantly decreased due to their simple structure. The antagonist-agonist actuator outperforms the dielectric elastomer minimum energy structure in terms of actuation displacement and response time. We conduct experiments in a lifesize human face model. The experiments demonstrate the capability of antagonist-agonist artificial muscles to mimic eyeball motions in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. Future work includes modeling and control of artificial muscles for optimal performance of various humanoid eyeball motions.",,,"School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China; School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China; School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China; School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"

The construction of the initial function, very important to obtain a good approximation, is done using a separation of variables.

Zhang,2019,"2019 4th International Conference on Mechanical, Control and Computer Engineering (ICMCCE)",IEEE Conferences,2,"Collision accidents occur frequently during the current car driving, most of which are caused by improper driver behavior and misjudgment. This paper proposes an anti-collision assisted driving system design for vehicle overtaking. The main function of the system is to remind the driver when to change the time of the lane change for safety, so as to achieve the anti-collision effect. Firstly, the lane changing process is analyzed. Then based on the research of the optimal path planning strategy for vehicle lane change, two variable path trajectory curve models of polynomial function and sinusoidal function are selected. Finally, the critical collision time point is derived and calculated in combination with the established model. After this time point, the lane change can ensure the safety of driving. The model is simulated and the ""human-car-road"" model is established by CarSim: driver control model, vehicle dynamics model and road scene model. And combined with MATLAB, the simulation is carried out from the longitudinal relative speed of the two vehicles and the horizontal relative distance between the two vehicles. The results show that the critical time calculated by the sinusoidal model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is lower, and the critical time calculated by the polynomial curve model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is higher. At the same time, the safety critical time points will decrease as the relative speed and the relative distance increase. The design of the assisted driving system proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the collision accident of the car and can lay a good foundation for intelligent driving.",Vehicle anti collision;Assisted driving system;Vehicle lane change,,"School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Automotive Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Wuhan University of Technology"

Cox,2021,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Surveillance cameras are commonly used along US highways by State Departments of Transportation (DOT) to monitor the traffic status. State-of-the-art automatic traffic status monitoring requires that the cameras be preset at a predefined zoom level and viewing direction. However, in deployed systems these cameras have zoom, pan, and tilt features. The DOT operators will change the zoom level and camera viewing direction to gather traffic information for analysis. Therefore, the road and lane locations on the camera image cannot be at preset values. It is desirable to develop an intelligent system to automatically detect road and lanes using highway surveillance video with any zoom level and viewing direction. This paper describes a novel lane identification framework based on the Deep Learning starting point: YOLOv4 vehicle detection. This new technique does not use any painted lane markings. We identify the vehicles on the road and then aggregate the detected vehicles at one horizontal line on the image. This salient horizontal line is where the YOLOv4 gives the highest vehicle detection confidence scores. Most vehicles stay within a lane most of the time and change lanes only occasionally. This assumption is used to find the lane center locations according to the relative number of vehicles passing the salient horizontal line.

Guvenc,2022,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,8,"In this article, we explore the fundamental limits of the 3-dimensional (3D) localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in conjunction with the effects of 3D antenna radiation patterns. Although localization of UAVs has been studied to some extent in the literature, effects of antenna characteristics on 3D localization remains mostly unexplored. To study such effects, we consider a scenario where a fixed number of radio-frequency (RF) sensors equipped with single or multiple dipole antennas are placed at some known locations on the ground, and they derive the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements from the time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected for the UAV that is also equipped with a dipole antenna. We then use these measurements to estimate the 3D location of the UAV, and to derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the localization error for various orientations of the dipole antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. Namely, we consider vertical-vertical (VV), horizontal-horizontal (HH), and vertical-horizontal (VH) radiation patterns in a purely line-of-sight (LoS) environment and a mixed LoS/Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment. We show that the localization accuracy changes in a non-monotonic pattern with respect to the UAV altitude and identify the respective critical altitudes for each of the VV, VH and HH orientations. Subsequently, we propose a multi-antenna signal acquisition technique that mitigates the accuracy degradation due to the antenna pattern mismatches, and we derive the localization CRLB for the multi-antenna scenario.

The controller is designed in the image plane directly with the aid of image Jacobian matrix. In order to decouple the horizontal translation from the rotation of pitch angle and roll angle of the UAV, a virtual camera method is adopted to compensate the effect of UAV’s attitude changes. For the purpose of enabling the UAV to land from a high altitude, we design a nested 2D tag to ensure the detection within a large altitude range. However, due to the shake of the boat, the landing tag is no longer horizontal, which increases the difficulty of obtaining the desired position of the feature point. To solve the problem, we solely use the tag center in the image as the input, then the desired position of it will coincide with the image center of the virtual camera, irrespective of whether the tag is horizontal. Furthermore, Kalman filter is introduced to optimally estimate the position of the feature point with observation noise. Finally, simulation experiments based on Gazebo and the field experiments based on the deck simulation platform are conducted.

This method negates the need for multi-position rotation or a complex rotating mechanism. First, the coupling relationship between the error state variables is analytically derived. Based on the equivalence relationship between the acceleration output and the angular rate output and error state variables, an improved extended-measurement equation is then established. The feasibility of the scheme that accelerates the convergence speed is theoretically demonstrated, and the observability of the proposed method is qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in comparisons with established methods (piece-wise constant system, singular value decomposition, and error covariance matrix analysis). The results confirm that the improved measurement model enhances the observability of state variables to different extent and can achieve complete observability of the system. The proposed method not only can provide the fast and accurate estimation of the alignment error, but also can predict the gyro bias online. More specifically, the equivalent horizontal accelerometer output certainly accelerated the convergence of the horizontal alignment error, and introducing the equivalent gyroscope output improved the convergence speed of the heading alignment error.

However, this significant kinematic relationship has not been analyzed yet on sloped ground. One relevant difficulty of studying ICR behavior on inclined terrain, even on a flat surface, is the continuous variation of pitch and roll angles while turning. To overcome this problem, this paper analyzes a dynamic simulation of a skid-steer vehicle on horizontal ground where gravity is substituted by an equivalent external force in such a way that pitch and roll are kept constant. Relevant tread ICR variations on inclined ground have been deduced, which have a significant impact on skid-steer kinematics.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hypothesis terrain-aided navigation framework where horizontal position measurements are generated along with their covariance matrices from the estimated terrain heights. These measurements are fused with appropriate navigation hypotheses in a closed-loop configuration where augmented navigation error state estimates are fed into the navigation solution of the corresponding hypothesis. The number of hypotheses and their covariances change adaptively based on the terrain under the flight path preventing deviation from the true position for multi-modal or non-informative regions.

It utilizes the phenomenon called Vortex Shedding effect wherein once the wind passes through a bluff body, it produces shedding effect that yields vibration. The linear generator uses the mechanism of a spring wherein excess motion due to wind energy is captured by the spring and stored as elastic potential energy which will later be converted as oscillating kinetic energy when the speed drops.

Their phases are orthogonal and amplitudes can be controlled to be equal by adjusting the tilted angle of the horizontal LP structure and the length of the vertical LP structure. Moreover, the longitudinal metal strip patch is modified to the V-shaped strip patch, which can realize the field cancellation, thereby achieving the boresight radiation for such a leaky-wave antenna. Furthermore, a low SLL is realized by controlling the aperture-field distribution to obtain the desired amplitude distribution and the relatively small axial ratio. In addition, because of the short waveguide wavelength of the SIIG, this feedline can be used to achieve the small interelement spacing and element size, thereby realizing the short length of the array.

As an alternative to fully polarimetric (FP) SARs, which provide complete scattering information, compact polarimetric (CP) SARs transmit a polarized signal different from conventional horizontal and vertical ones, while receiving coherently the backscattered signal. Hence, they could obtain partial polarimetric information while maintaining a large swath-width, which makes it an ideal tool for marine oil spills observation. However, the proper selection of compact polarimetric SAR modes still remains a critical issue. By transmitting SAR signal with different polarizations, the scattering mechanism of the sea surface can be reflected by different CP SAR features. Hence, it is necessary to analyze the behavior of sea surface scattering as experienced by different CP SAR modes, i. e., different transmitted polarization. In this paper, a unified framework was applied to derive compact polarimetric SAR features under General Transmit and Linear Receive (GTLR) polarization configurations. Following the rationale of polarization signature, the characteristics of features derived by transmitting signals under different roll and ellipticity angles are analyzed.

However, most of the current studies are still experiments conducted on the horizontal plane but carrying out north-seeking research on non-horizontal planes is also much valuable because it is common in practical scenarios, such as in the mining and drilling environment. In this paper, a feasible dynamic north-finder method for a micro inertial measurement unit (MIMU) based on the MEMS technology on a tilting plane is proposed. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is used to analyze the appropriate rotation rate, and the tilting angle and heading angle are calculated in real time by an optimal weighted fusion based on recursive least squares (OWFBRLS) algorithm. Higher-precision orientation results can be achieved through the introduction of the optimal weighted fusion (OWF) theory. This paper demonstrates the experimental method and data processing in detail. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate inclinations and headings, and the standard deviation (SD) of heading angle can reach approximately 0.6° in 3 minutes, which is superior to the methods in the literature and still has high precision in the case of large tilting angles.

Many laboratories use motion-capture to estimate CoM, while others use force-plate based estimates, either because they cannot access motion-capture or they do not want to be taxed with post-processing optoelectronic data. Three force-plate derived center of mass estimation algorithms were compared against a benchmark motion-capture technique. Two of them have recently been reported in the literature, and both rely on numerical integration of 2nd-order differential equations. We propose a third technique that uses an algebraic equation to directly relate center of pressure to center of mass without numerical drift. Twenty-four healthy adults participated in a five-minute steady-state walking test to compare these algorithms. The sample-by-sample standard deviation of the three force-plate based algorithms from the motion-capture benchmark algorithm was evaluated. The algebraic technique provided less error than either of the two more common integration techniques (p<0.05).

By attaching a waveguide to the array, the effective interelement spacing is reduced to half wavelength. This enables grating lobe-free transmit and receive beamforming with a uniform rectangular array of efficient low-cost transducers. The system further includes custom transceiver electronics, an field programmable gate array (FPGA) system-on-chip and a PC for GPU accelerated frequency domain signal processing, consisting of matched filtering, conventional beamforming, and envelope extraction using Nvidia Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and OpenGL for visualization. The uniform rectangular layout allows utilizing multiple transmit and receive methods, known from medical imaging applications. Thus, the system is dynamically adaptable to maximize the frame rate or detection range. One implemented method demonstrates the real-time capability by transmitting a hemispherical pulse (HP) with a single transducer to irradiate the surroundings simultaneously, whereas all transducers are used for echo reception. The imaging properties, such as axial and lateral resolution, field of view and range of view, are characterized in an anechoic chamber. The object localization is validated for a horizontal and vertical field of view of ±80° and a range of view of 0.5-3 m with 29 frames/s.

The study proposes a new set of weights, or MVDR replica vectors, that are based on the physics of the propagating Lamb modes, including the symmetric mode S0, the antisymmetric mode A0, and the shear horizontal mode SH0. Numerical results show that these wave-mode weights, combined with geometrical spreading, improve the focus of the array by increasing the dynamic range and the spatial resolution of the image. In addition, quite dramatic improvements in image quality are achieved by combining, or compounding, the multiple Lamb modes naturally present in the plate in both transmission and reflection.

We propose a novel pedestrian POS solution for indoor MMS using backpack INS, foot mounted pedestrian dead reckoning (Foot-PDR) and sparse control points with known coordinates. The Foot-PDR can provide continuous high precision positioning with the corrections of the control points to maintain its absolute accuracy. Such precise positioning is integrated with the backpack INS to estimate the accurate position and orientation, similar to the GNSS/INS integration for the outdoor environment. The lever-arm variation issue between the backpack INS and the Foot-PDR is solved by catching a specific phase of the gait cycle that has consistent relative pose between the back and the heel of pedestrians. The feasibility of the proposed POS was verified by an outdoor large-scale open-sky area and an indoor office environment tests. The outdoor experimental results demonstrate that the estimated horizontal position and yaw angle has an accuracy of 0.07 m and 0.6°, respectively (when the control points are as sparse as 50 meters). The indoor experimental results demonstrate that the position accuracy is 0.07 m, 0.08 m, and 0.04 m, along the north, east, and height directions.

This study evaluated the possibility of using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a feature selection technique to find out which anatomical plane provides the most useful information in gait analysis. For this purpose, 3-dimensional marker trajectories of 14 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill with three different speeds were captured. Then, PCA was applied to each gait cycle data to find out variables with the most variation. Afterwards, to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of PCA results, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used.

Deep learning methods in the field of ground penetrating radar image denoising mainly include non-blind denoising studies based on a single additive Gaussian white noise, and blind denoising studies based on masks. Due to the presence of multiple composite noises in GPR images, methods based on such a single noise perform poorly in practical denoising work; and blind denoising deep learning methods based on image masking lose feature details of anomalous regions.

Toepfer,2019,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,1,"This paper examines airplane response to flap extension on seven general aviation airplanes. The scenario involves a pilot flying in the traffic pattern who becomes distracted, abruptly extends flaps while looking outside the airplane, and fails to notice airspeed and pitch-attitude changes. In the Code of Federal Regulation ∮23.143, the Federal Aviation Administration requires no more than 50 pounds of pitch wheel force to arrest any un-commanded airplane pitch response. The airplanes tested in this report had pitch forces less than 40 pounds. Despite satisfying the FAA requirement, data gathered in-flight showed a pitch-up to more than 30 degrees in 5 seconds after flap extension, subsequently causing airspeed to drop below stall speed for four of the airplanes. If the pilot did not compensate for this response with positive pitch inputs on the controls, the airplanes would have stalled. At traffic pattern altitudes, stalling an airplane can be fatal. The National Transportation Safety Board listed over 1000 accidents caused by loss-of-control in the traffic pattern between 1982 and 2015. Since general aviation airplanes do not carry flight data recorders, it is unknown how many of those accidents may have involved stalls caused by un-commanded response after flap extension. From the data gathered in-flight, it seems possible some were. To improve safety, airplane developers could interconnect flaps with the elevator, reduce horizontal tail size, or use a T-tail.

Our visual detection algorithm allows the user to specify an arbitrary object to detect its movements in the image plane. In the horizontal plane, we use the lateral velocity controller to keep tracking with the object in the center of the camera image. In the vertical profile, we adopted a log polynomial velocity to guarantee zero closing velocity and acceleration at touchdown. During the tracking phase, the quadrotor tracks the object continuously while maintaining a fixed altitude from the object and keeps it in the center. Once the quadrotor satisfies the landing condition, it moves on to the landing phase at the planned vertical velocity until touchdown. Here, we use the ultrasound sensor running kalman filter to detect the landing condition.

This work presents the Gravity Normal frame, a novel navigation reference frame developed specifically for autonomous vehicle applications. This moving path frame incorporates the knowledge that many autonomous vehicles operate in a gravitational field, and control strategies must account for this. Given a curve in space that represents a desired trajectory, the proposed strategy generates a navigation frame that is well defined regardless of path curvature, while guaranteeing the normal vector is always normal to gravity and hence constrained to the horizontal plane, regardless of path torsion. Due to these characteristics, the Gravity Normal path frame is ideally suited for vehicles with distinct longitudinal and lateral dynamics since the resulting cross-track errors have a precise physical interpretation. The properties of the navigation frame are derived, and its usefulness is showcased through simulation.

To achieve effective non-horizontal payload hoisting, the two booms of DBCs should reach different positions while guaranteeing safety, high efficiency, and energy conservation, which makes coordinated boom motions particularly difficult. To this end, an optimal collaborative motion planning method for DBCs is proposed in this paper without any linearization, which realizes fast, accurate, and energy-saving payload transportation with swing suppression.

1734,Some Key Parameters for Revolving Armature-Type Railgun,Y. Liu; K. Huang; T. Zhang; W. Fan; W. Guo,2020,IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,IEEE Journals,3,"High-speed rotation of the launching components (armature and projectile) is one of the most important ways to improve the firing accuracy of railgun, and the rotation can be obtained by the electromagnetic torques generated by the armature. However, the concrete design or parameter study of the revolving armature-type railgun (RATR) is rarely mentioned. In this article, some key parameters of RATR-interior rail spacing dc, outer rail horizontal spacing dm and vertical spacing du, armature slot width dw, length dL, and quantity N-are studied. On the basis of the initial structure of RATR, the structural parameters of the RATR are changed respectively. Based on the analysis of armature electromagnetic forces (armature thrust, electromagnetic pressure, and armature torque), the relationship of some key parameters of 15-mm caliber RATR are proposed. Conclusion can be drawn that increasing dc can increase the armature electromagnetic forces, but reduce the maximum current that can be transmitted between the armature and the rail. The optimal interval of dv is 9 mm <; dv <; 13 mm, where dm and dv have the greatest influence on the armature torque, so that the armature rotation speed can be controlled by controlling the horizontal and vertical spacing. Armature slot width dw has little influence on the electromagnetic forces (<; 0.13), but increasing d L can significantly increase the electromagnetic pressure and then increase contact stability. Finally, for the railgun, the optimal number of the slot in the revolving armature is N = 6.",Electromagnetic forces;railgun;revolving armature;slot;structural optimum design,,"Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, China; Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, China; Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, China; Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, China; Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, China"

The laser scanner systems have various disturbances and uncertainties, such as manufacturing tolerances, structure vibrations, and parameter uncertainties. Further, there are vertical and horizontal resonance modes that hinder controller design. In this letter, we propose a reference modulation technique to enhance the vertical angle linearity of the slow axis for two-dimensional laser scanner systems. First, the laser scanner system is mathematically modeled in the state-space form. Then, the reference modulation is designed to boost the loop gain over the desired frequency range. The reference modulation can guarantee high-quality scan images by redesigning the desired reference based on the output feedback. The current tracking controller was then implemented with virtual references for the states. We investigated its tracking performance via sensitivity function analysis against the disturbances. Experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using four different laser scanners. We confirmed that the proposed method achieved up to 48% improvement in the angle tracking error from the experimental results.",High quality scan image;vertical angle linearity;two-dimensional laser scanner;reference modulation;sensitivity function analysis,,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea; Division of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"

The azimuth angle indicates the direction of the target in a horizontal plane while the elevation angle indicates the direction of target signal in a vertical plane established from a passive line array sonar. The acoustic signals gathered by the line array sonar have different elevation angles as they propagate through multiple paths. The target angle measured by the line array sonar is, in fact, a conical angle that indicates the direction of incoming signal to the line array sonar system. Therefore, bottom bounce path produces an inaccurate target location if it is interpreted as the azimuth angle in the horizontal plane as is commonly used in exiting Target Motion Analysis (TMA) technologies. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the conical angle effect on bearings-only TMA (BO-TMA).

However, this conductivity invariance lift-off is fixed for a particular sensor setup, which is not convenient for various sample conditions. In this paper, we propose using two parameters in the coil design – the horizontal and vertical distances between the transmitter and the receiver to control the conductivity invariance lift-off. The relationship between these two parameters and the conductivity invariance lift-off is investigated by simulation and experiments and it has been found that there is an approximate linear relationship between these two parameters and the conductivity invariance lift-off. This is useful for applications where the measurements have restrictions on lift-off, e.g. uneven coating thickness which limits the range of the lift-off of probe during the measurements.

To monitor systems, networks, applications and services the CSOC must first on-board the systems and services onto their security monitoring and incident management platforms. Cyber Onboarding (a.k.a. Onboarding) is a specialist technical process of setting up and configuring systems and services to produce appropriate events, logs and metrics which are monitored through the CSOC security monitoring and incident management platform. First, logging must be enabled on the systems and applications, second, they must produce the right set of computing and security logs, events, traps and messages which are analysed by the detection controls, security analytics systems and security event monitoring systems such as SIEM, and sensors etc.; and further, network-wide information e.g. flow data, heartbeats and network traffic information are collected and analysed, and finally, threat intelligence data are ingested in real-time to detect, or be informed of threats which are out in the wild.

To collect the required data, flight patterns that contained several types of movements were defined, where the flight data log that contained missions, GPS, and battery, was collected. The preprocessing included the movement separation and also included the acceleration and the deceleration of horizontal movement. Finally, the regression was done using the Elastic Net Regression from Sklearn.

Despite complex, repeated collisions and slippage between robot legs and obstacles, the robot's horizontal plane body orientation (yaw) trajectory can converge in the absence of any body level feedback to stable steady state patterns. We classify these patterns into a series of “types” ranging from stable locked equilibria, to stable periodic oscillations, to unstable or mixed period oscillations. We observe that the stable equilibria can bifurcate to stable periodic oscillations and then to mixed period oscillations as the obstacle spacing is gradually increased. Using a 3D-reconstruction method, we experimentally characterize the robot leg-obstacle contact configurations at each step to show that the different steady patterns in robot orientation trajectories result from a self-stabilizing periodic pattern of leg-obstacle contact positions. We present a highly-simplified coupled oscillator model that predicts robot orientation pattern as a function of the leg-obstacle contact mechanism. We demonstrate that the model successfully captures the robot steady state for different obstacle spacing and robot initial conditions.

Because the outer surface is in different planes, when spraying the upper and lower surfaces or side surfaces, due to the existence of gravity or external environment, or when the distance from the spray gun to the spraying operation surface changes, the coating efficiency will change. Therefore, the thickness of the coating on the outer surface of the workpiece is inconsistent, which affects the quality of the coating and leads to the decline of the fireproof performance. Aiming at the above problems, this paper finds out the proportional relationship between spraying speed and coating efficiency, and solves the problem of coating thickness uniformity caused by the change of coating efficiency by increasing or decreasing the moving speed of spray gun.

For example, the variation of the slip angle, time required and horizontal & vertical displacement, where the slip angles indicate the stability of the car and time and displacement shows the control flexibility. Such performance parameters are closely related to the vehicle's position of centroid, which can also be interpreted as the distance between centroid and front/rear wheel of the vehicle. When designing the car, engine position as well as mechanical structures is going to affect the centroid-wheel distance.

A. Nadzri; Z. Ab Aziz; A. M. Halil; A. Jamil Sulaiman Hanifah,2020,2020 11th IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) and Eddy Current Testing (ECT) in Nondestructive Testing (NDT) are considered as commonly used techniques in the detection of cracks within metallic materials. MFL relies on the analysis of the flux leakages, while ECT relies on the analysis of eddy currents that resides within a metallic sample. The conventional MFL system, however, requires a strong magnetic field to be applied to a sample to achieve magnetic saturation so that strong flux leakages can be produced. In this work, an unsaturated differential magnetic probe that utilizes the highly sensitive AMR sensors is developed, which aims to eliminate the need for the sample saturation. Besides that, the ECT is rarely applied to ferromagnetic materials due to the large distribution of the magnetization signals compared to the eddy current signal. Thus, the phase-sensitive detection technique is proposed using a digital lock-in amplifier, which will allow the separation of both MFL and ECT signals. Besides that, a 2-mm carbon steel plate is used as the sample for this work. The surface of the plate is engraved with artificial slits with different directions, which are 0° (horizontal), 45°, and 90° (vertical). Then, a 2-D map measurement is conducted from the backside of the sample. From the results, the slits with the direction of 45° and 90° can be clearly observed for both real and imaginary components. However, the 0° slits are nowhere to be seen within the backside 2-D map for both real and imaginary components. Furthermore, the optimum frequency for the 2-D map measurement is concluded to be at 110 Hz for both MFL and ECT.

We first analyze the horizontal compliance of the compliant mechanism and build a model to relate its state and force. The insertion is separated into two stages according to the insertion type. The first stage is a compliant insertion and we estimate the insertion direction based on the built model, horizontally compensate resorting to the horizontal compliance and the updated direction, and efficiently plan the vertical insertion in an aggressive strategy regarding the uncertainties caused by the compliant mechanism and predicting the future insertion. The second stage is a hybrid insertion with both rigid and compliant gripping and its features include that the object states are not precisely measurable and the motion of a part of the object is not directly controllable. To solve it, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze all possible configurations and, taking advantage of the insertion property, conclude one insertion posture based on which a control strategy is proposed.

The reason for that is that typically they rely on horizontal elasticity to cope with the varying demand for resources, which induces high overhead in the event of a cold -start. Recent literature has focused on minimizing the overhead of horizontal elasticity using mechanisms such as snapshots. However, the spawning of new function instances still requires several tens of milliseconds. This paper proposes vertical elasticity to scale resources of serverless functions to cope with bursting workloads. We design LatEst, a controller for serverless frameworks that adapts the allocated resources of active function instances. U sing vertical scaling, LatEst can adjust to bursts of function invocations within a few milliseconds. LatEst implements a feed-back control loop to: (1) predict the required resources during workload changes and (2) react rapidly and accurately to such changes. Moreover, LatEst spawns new instances for functions when the resources of the underlying server are reaching their limit. We evaluate LatEst as an extension of vHive [1] and find that LatEst can improve tail latency of serverless functions up to 25x compared to vHive.",Vertical Scaling;Resource management;Tail latency;Knative;Machine Learning,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Greece; Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Institute of Computer Science (ICS), Heraklion, Greece; Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Institute of Computer Science (ICS), Heraklion, Greece; Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Greece"

Inspired by deployable structures, a new design concept, namely monolithically spatial compliant mechanism (MSCM) is proposed to minimize the overall structure. Based on MSCM, a folding operation is employed uniquely by arranging three typical kinds of basic MAM modules with two sets of hooke joints. Due to the spatial structure, the dimensions in horizontal plane is reduced by 60.94%. Furthermore, the proposed nano-positioner demonstrates the simultaneous design of large-ratio amplification mechanism, compact, highly flexible, and assembly-free spatial XY platform with integrated Z platform. Analytical modeling is carried out, and finite element analysis is conducted to optimize the geometric parameters. A prototype is fabricated to verify the performances of the nano-positioner through tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum displacements in x-, y-, and z-axes can reach 177.33, 179.30, and 17.45 μm, respectively. The motion amplification ratios in the x- and y-axes can reach 10.19 and 10.30, respectively. Moreover, by adopting proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller, the closed-loop control experiments are conducted. The results show that the motion resolution in three axes can all reach 5 nm.

Through controlled sinusoidal drive signals, this mechanically simple locomotion system allows the robot to crawl through small gaps about half the height of spaces through which it could fly thanks to the robot's transition from a vertical to horizontal orientation when crawling. On smooth hard surfaces, the robot is capable of crawling at 100 mm/s. Gaining a terrestrial mode of movement not only expands its locomotion strategies and environmental adaptability, but it also improves the endurance of the robot in particular missions due to the low power consumption. A unique design principle is that the flight components of the robot are unchanged from the original aerial robot design, and terrestrial locomotion is realized with the addition of two capstan-interlinked pairs of legs constructed from 3D printed plastic and carbon fiber rods.

Combined with the control idea of continuous flight system, we preliminarily estimate the navigation information through the sequence real-time inter-frame registration, and optimize and evaluate the satellite remote sensing reference map combined with the current estimated pose information, and scale and crop the reference map area to be registered. Then, the real-time map at the current moment is matched with the optimized high-similarity area reference map, which can effectively reduce the amount of matching calculation, improve the matching stability, and realize autonomous scene matching navigation and positioning that is decoupled from the planned route.

Wada,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Muscle synergy is the theory that movements are controlled by a module of coordinated combined muscles. This theory is thought to solve the degrees-of-freedom problem in the musculoskeletal system. Previous studies have investigated the robustness of muscle synergies under conditions such as varying speeds and required degrees of accuracy. One of the principles of human movement is that when movement becomes faster, spatial accuracy is reduced. This is called the ""speed-accuracy trade-off"" (SAT), and many models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Studies on muscle synergies have shown that muscle synergy modules are robust against changes in speed; however, the relationship between SAT and motor control by muscle synergies remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between changes in spatial accuracy and changes in speed and muscle synergies from measured behavioral data and surface electromyography. This was achieved by performing an isometric contraction task in which subjects exerted a horizontal force with various movement speeds. The results showed that the module structures of muscle synergies were robust against speed changes, and that the neural commands to muscle synergies changed in response to speed changes. In addition, changes in spatial accuracy with variations in speed tended to increase when movement was performed with a single muscle synergy. These results suggest that the number of muscle synergies used for movement may affect movement accuracy.",,,"Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata, Japan; Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata, Japan; Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata, Japan; Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata, Japan"

In this work, an advanced MV searching algorithm is proposed. The key idea is to adjust the searching window according to the global motion vector of previous coded frame. The movement of a video can be classified into object motion and camera movement. That is, total motion = object motion + camera movement. The camera movement introduce the global motion vector, which is usually the same for any part of a video. Moreover, for most of videos, the direction of object motion usually distributes non-uniformly. For example, the video taken from the roads has much more horizontal motions than vertical motions. Based on these facts, in this work, we proposed an effective MV searching algorithm using global motion information and direction priors to design a dynamic searching window.

Although high-grade inertial navigation systems aided by Doppler velocity logs can operate without external position references for extended durations, this may still be required to meet survey specifications. This paper presents a trajectory planning algorithm for an autonomous surface vessel with the purpose of aiding the navigation of one or multiple underwater vehicles using ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear program for the single-vehicle tracking scenario and mixed-integer nonlinear program for tracking of multiple vehicles. In the absence of external acoustic positioning, the horizontal uncertainties of all targets increase as functions of time and heading. The optimal placement of the surface vessel is calculated by considering the propagated acoustic measurement uncertainty, which varies according to the range and direction towards the target. The trajectories are generated by minimizing the uncertainty of all targets, while also considering penalties on the control inputs and obeying vessel kinematics. The approach is demonstrated through a series of simulations.",Acoustic measurements;autonomous vehicles;marine navigation;optimal control;path planning;position measurement;trajectory optimization;unmanned underwater vehicles,,"Department of Marine Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway; Department of Marine Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway; Department of Marine Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"

Zhao,2023,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,0,"Ku-band scatterometers are sensitive to rain effects due to their centimeter-scale radar wavelength. The NSCAT-4DS geophysical model function (GMF) corrects for sea surface temperature (SST), whereas it does not consider rain. Rain causes biases in the retrieved wind fields, and to prevent these, quality control (QC) flags play an important role in rain identification. Since horizontal polarization and vertical polarization radar beams have a particular sensitivity to rain clouds, a noticeable difference between the rain-dominated backscatter distribution and the wind-dominated backscatter distribution is observed. Employing a Bayesian approach and exploiting these particular wind and rain backscatter characteristics, we propose an algorithm to provide the posterior rain probability for each measurement in a wind vector cell and test the method for the Haiyang-2C scatterometer. In a comprehensive comparison between posterior rain probability, Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) QC flag, and Joss flag, for posterior rain probabilities higher than 0.5, the rejection rate is approximately a quarter of that of the KNMI QC flag with better rain detection behavior. While the Joss flag, the difference between the retrieved wind speed and the 2-D variational ambiguity removal analysis wind speed, has the best performance in identifying rain in the sweet swath, it comes at the cost of a higher missing rate. The comparison with advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) winds also proves the method’s effectiveness. Posterior rain probability has the best rain identification ability in the nadir swath.

Neural networks (NNs) provide flexible, end-to-end solutions to point cloud processing tasks. Yet, one of the unavoidable problems in training the NNs is the difficulty in collecting and labeling high-quality point cloud data. Existing point cloud datasets are often collected at different scales and densities. Directly combining highly heterogeneous datasets might violate data protection regulations, but also lead to degradation of model performance. In our experiments, naive horizontal federated learning has been applied to alleviate the data privacy concern. However, when the datasets are not identically distributed, the federated model's performance falls far behind the state-of-the-art of centralized models. This paper investigates the union of highly heterogeneous point cloud datasets for the object classification task. In the proposed framework, the federated model is split into shared and personalized modules.

In order to effectively extract the real gravity gradient signal from the strong noise, a gravity gradient noise reduction method based on the equivalent source model is proposed by using the basic principle that the earth's gravity field is a conservative force field. First, according to the relationship between the rectangular prism and the gravity gradient, the analytical model of the equivalent source is derived, and the regression equation of the equivalent source is established. Aiming at the ill conditioned problem of regression operators, Tikhonov regularization method is proposed, and the optimal regularization parameters are determined by L-curve method, which can reduce the noise of gravity gradient measurement by an order of magnitude in simulation. Using this method to process the measured data of the shipborne test, the results show that this method has an obvious effect on suppressing the dynamic measurement noise of the gravity gradiometer, and can reduce the internal coincidence mean square error of the horizontal tensor gravity gradient measurement signal by 58%, which is of engineering significance.",,,"College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineer University, Nangang District, Harbin, CHINA; College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineer University, Nangang District, Harbin, CHINA; Tianjin Navigation Instrument Research Institute Xianyang, Hongqiao District, Tianjin, CHINA; Tianjin Navigation Instrument Research Institute Xianyang, Hongqiao District, Tianjin, CHINA; Tianjin Navigation Instrument Research Institute Xianyang, Hongqiao District, Tianjin, CHINA; Tianjin Navigation Instrument Research Institute Xianyang, Hongqiao District, Tianjin, CHINA"

1838,Hybrid Laser-LED Transmitter With Closed-Loop Beam-Steering Control for Indoor Optical Wireless Communication,F. Ahmad; R. N. Sathisha; K. M. Jyothsna; V. Raghunathan,2022,Journal of Lightwave Technology,IEEE Journals,2,"In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid Laser-LED transmitter module for indoor optical wireless communication with closed-loop, non-mechanical beam steering capability. The hybrid transmitter module consists of a near infrared laser diode for data communication and white LED array for illumination, combined on a diffuser surface. Dual-axis non-mechanical beam steering of the laser beam is implemented using two off-centered liquid lenses. The diffused laser beam directed towards the receiver is steered over an angular range of −7.6o to 7.6o (−1.7o to 2.6o) along the horizontal (vertical) axes spanning −200 to 200 mm (−44 to 67 mm) at the receiver placed 1.5-meter from the transmitter. M-QAM/OFDM in combination with adaptive bit-and power-loading is utilized to achieve a total data throughput of 5.15 Gbps for the diffused laser beam with steering. Laser intensity levels as measured at the receiver plane are kept below the maximum permissible exposure limit for indoor usage across the entire beam steering range. Closed-loop beam steering is also demonstrated by scanning the transmitted laser beam horizontally, measuring the signal strength using a low bandwidth photodetector and locking the laser beam to the receiver position for data-communication. Such hybrid transmitters offer the benefit of decoupling the data communication and illumination requirements of the indoor optical link, thereby tailoring the individual light emitter's performance to specific use-case.",Beam steering;liquid lens;optical wireless communication;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;visible light communication,,"Electrical Communication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; Electrical Communication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; Electrical Communication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; Electrical Communication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"
1839,Is the room moving? Muscle responses following visual perturbations,D. C. Porras; J. V. Jacobs; R. Inzelberg; O. Keren; G. Zeilig; M. Plotnik,2019,2019 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR),IEEE Conferences,2,"Postural adjustments are essential for balance control and to reduce risk of falling. One emerging method to train reactive postural control consists in exposing individuals to safe and controlled destabilizing perturbations that intend to simulate changing conditions that can lead to falls. Studies using virtual reality suggest that visual perturbations engage mechanisms of motor adaptation, increase electrocortical activity and modulate balance performance. What is not yet clear is the impact of trunk and limb muscles activation on the postural adjustments responsible to maintain balance control. This paper aims to map the response of trunk and limb muscles to visual perturbations, and compare them to those of physical perturbations. Additionally, our study includes vertical perturbations (i.e. balance disturbances in the vertical plane) known to be a major cause of falling. Therefore, this paper also compares muscles responses to both horizontal and vertical perturbations. Fourteen healthy participants (ten males; age: 27±4; BMI: 23.8±2.6 kg/m2) stood on a moveable platform within a virtual reality system projecting visual scenes over a 360° dome-shaped screen such that the participant appeared to be standing in the middle of a room. Concomitantly, the electrical activity of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, hamstring, rectus abdominis, paraspinal, external oblique and deltoid muscles was captured. Amid a larger protocol, this paper reports on randomly presented 1) visual perturbations; i.e. the virtual room moves during 0.35 seconds a distance corresponding to 14 cm in four directions (forward - FP, backward - BP, upward - UP, downward - DP), each repeated three times; and 2) physical perturbations (12cm displacement in one second) for the four directions and two sensory conditions: static camera (SC; virtual room remains static) and dynamic camera (DC; corresponding transitions in the visual scenery). We calculated three muscle activation parameters: onset latency, duration of activation, and magnitude. Separate 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA were applied for each outcome measure across factors of perturbation direction (FP, BP, UP and DP) and condition (VIS, SC, DC). Forward visual perturbations led to longer onset latencies when compared to upward and downward visual perturbations (e.g. in the gastrocnemius: respectively, 443±56.6 ms vs. 326±39.6 ms and 334±51.1 ms, P<; 0.05). Duration of activation was longer following downward visual perturbations than after backward visual perturbations in the rectus femoris (respectively, 630±120 ms vs 335±81.2 ms, P<; 0.05). All lower limbs and the paraspinal muscles presented with a longer onset latency in response to visual perturbations in comparison to both types of physical perturbations (SC and DC) (P<; 0.05). The magnitude of activation following visual perturbations was smaller than both types of physical perturbations in all muscles (P<; 0.05). Duration of activation was also longer in the gastrocnemius following visual perturbations when compared to both SC and DC conditions of physical perturbations (P<; 0.05). Overall, magnitude of responses was often larger following horizontal perturbations in comparison to vertical perturbations. Our results suggest that visual perturbations alone activate limb and trunk muscles. Although perturbation direction seems to regulate the timing of response following visual perturbations in some limbs muscles, no differences were observed in the magnitude of activation within visual perturbations. Physical perturbations significantly increased EMG responses compared with visual perturbations. Overall, horizontal perturbations often led to faster and more intense responses than vertical perturbations. Our findings that different types of perturbations lead to more or less intense muscle responses and to different activation timing may have translational benefits for the optimization of rehabilitation strategies implementing destabilizing perturbations and oriented to persons at risk of falling.",vision;posture;perturbation;virtual reality;standing,,"Center of Advanced Technologies in Rehabilitation, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel; Rehabilitation and Movement Science, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA; The Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Acquired Brain Injury, Rehabilitation Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel; Department of Neurological, Rehabilitation, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel; Center of Advanced Technologies in Rehabilitation, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel"

This is designed for assimilation and developing an aircraft with great aerodynamic characteristics with much higher efficiency of the model planned. In this project, we made Surveillance type aircraft which is the more stable in crosswind type situation and due to its light weight and great aerodynamic structure. It is more efficient than other aircraft types. The material which is used to construct this aircraft is depron foam sheet which is durable and lightweight. This aircraft has three flap system that is flap 1, which is 15 degree, flap 2 which is 30 degree and flap 3 which is 45 degree in angles.

The insect and the backpack are connected by electrodes, which can control the insect’s movement through electrical stimulation. Insects have many actuators and sensors in their small bodies and are expected to operate in confined spaces such as in rubble. Because they are small, several cyborgs are expected to be used simultaneously. Therefore, cyborg insects must be produced stably and operate autonomously. In this study, the Madagascar hissing cockroach is used to control turning and straight movement by electrical stimulation of the antennae and cerci. In conventional methods, implanting electrodes into the antennae is a complicated and difficult procedure, which is an obstacle to stable production. The new method was proposed using a cylindricaljig with a horizontal hole and a needle piercing from the side of the antenna, realizing simple and stable electrode implantation. Furthermore, a cyborg insect developed using the proposed method was implemented for heat source approach control movement.

Kao,2022,2022 IEEE 72nd Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),IEEE Conferences,3,"The development of direct Cu-to-Cu bonding technologies has attracted increasing attention due to the increased requirement for advanced high-density packaging. Among these technologies, the microfluidic electroless interconnection (MELI) process [1] can directly fabricate interconnection between Cu pillars at low temperatures without applying any pressure on the chips. The previous study [1] revealed that the uniform bonding of MELI-Cu can be achieved with the intermittent flow for chip-to-chip with 150 μm pitch and 50 μm standoff height. This study further improved the electroless Cu chip-to-chip bonding on Cu pillars with 28μm standoff height and pillar pitch down to 30 μm. To meet the requirement of real applications, in this study, the Cu pillar array of 17,600 pillars were divided into three equal regions, and each region with a different pitch, i.e., 30μm, 35μm and 45μm, respectively. As a result, the control of flow patterns is more critical due to the complicated Cu pillar pattern and the higher amount of hydrogen gas bubbles from the electroless Cu plating process. The chips were subjected to electroless plating chemical in a microfluidic system under an ambient condition of 50°C and the intermittent oscillatory flow was implemented into the electroless bonding system. The microstructure and electroless plating behavior of the electroless Cu was investigated using ion-milling, focused ion beam (FIB), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that the primary cause of skip-plating and extraneous plating in the microfluidic system could result from loading factor and hydrogen gas bubbles. To enlarge the process window of the MELI-Cu for fine pitch, the additional pretreatment process was added before Cu plating to improve the deposition rate and deposition uniformity. Tensile test verified the bond strength of Cu-to-Cu bond can approach 80 MPa. To eliminate the defects within the Cu interconnection, the low-temperature post-annealing treatment also included in this study, and preliminary results showed that a high level of bonding quality without voids or seams can be obtained. Furthermore, a potential horizontal side-by-side MELI-Cu was proposed by using electroless Cu deposition on the surface around the Cu pillar. The horizontal Cu-to-Cu interconnection has a higher tolerance to the non-uniform Cu height and the misalignment of Cu pillars, regardless of the top-shaped of Cu pillar, which provides a competitive application compared to vertical interconnection.",Die bonding methods and processes;Die and package singulation manufacturing;Interconnects for high I/O thermo-compression/hybrid bonding;Fine-pitch/multi-layer RDL,,"Product Characterization, Corporate R&D Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Product Characterization, Corporate R&D Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Product Characterization, Corporate R&D Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Product Characterization, Corporate R&D Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Product Characterization, Corporate R&D Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan"

Finally, taking the three-phase horizontal distributed transmission lines as an example, we calculated the voltage coefficient matrix at various selected points, estimated the uncertainty contributions, and accomplished the test through the overvoltage experimental platform. From the result, the relative amplitude error of the overvoltage signal measured by the sensor installed at the optimal measuring point is less than 3.50%, the relative expanded uncertainty of the test at the optimal point is about 8.74%, and the values are much smaller than those of other measuring points, which proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Differential E-field coupling;inductive electromagnetic calculation;measuring point optimization;overvoltage measurement;self-decoupling,,"State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; Shaoxing Power Supply Bureau, State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company Ltd., Shaoxing, China; Chongqing Research Institute, State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company Ltd., Chongqing, China"

Dumitru,2022,2022 8th International Conference on Energy Efficiency and Agricultural Engineering (EE&AE),IEEE Conferences,1,"This paper describes the development and preliminary testing of a portable on-site testing system suitable for hydrokinetic turbines. In order to estimate the power produced by a full-scale hydrokinetic turbine in prototype phase, it is necessary to study several similar models on a progressive scale and to test them on dedicated benches, in laboratory conditions. The characterization of increased diameter rotors requires larger models that often exceed the test capabilities of the hydraulic laboratory test benches. In this case, testing should be performed on-site, in real operating conditions. In this regard, a specially designed test system that can characterize the hydrokinetic rotors with larger diameters in rivers or channels with significant velocities has to be used. The main advantages of such a testing system are that the rotors are easily swappable, the electronic and electric parts are placed outside the water and there is no need for grid connection, due to low power requirements. Thus, the system can be deployed only by using a laptop and a battery pack, making it suitable for remote areas. The purpose of the experiments described in this paper was to determine the characteristic parameters like power, mechanical torque or power coefficient for hydrokinetic rotors with same geometry but different diameters. This testing method is fast and accurate and contributes to a better understanding of horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines.",hydrokinetic turbine;on-site testing;electromagnetic brake;power coefficient,,"Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Renewable Sources and Energy Efficiency, National Institute for R&D in Electrical Engineering, Icpe-CA, Bucharest, Romania"
1853,A Topology Model: Towards Dense Freeway Network with Resource-Constrained Corridors,X. Xing; Y. Chen,2019,2019 5th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS),IEEE Conferences,0,"Influenced by social development, geographic features, national policies and other factors, the freeway network structure in some regions has been complex and diversified. In addition, land resources are quite limited in areas with the high network density. Existing research on road network topology model has not considered context sensitive information within the corridor zone where selection criteria of design indexes are still unclear. Some new road design concepts have been proposed in previous studies; however they are difficult to apply in practice due to the limitations of models and algorithms the studies used. Based on the topology model which may sufficiently consider spatially sensitive information and index flexibility design in corridors, a new freeway network topology model is proposed for the dense freeway network with resource-constrained corridors. In this model, different geometric design parameters are considered including road horizontal width and vertical elevation. Algorithms for these geometric design parameters are constructed to topological units of curved bin geometry (CBG), curved bin geometry of ramp (RCBG) and junction bin geometry (JBG). Ordinary road segment can be described in the order of CBG units, and the interchanges are mapped by RCBG and JBG units. Meanwhile, the model also considers surrounding road facilities (such as road sign and marking). In order to visualize the model, the data structure model of topology structure is constructed by using the doubly linked list. The topology model was applied to the regional road network in the city of Jiangmen using the ArcGIS platform. This paper provides a scientific and rational basic research model for the application research of safety and reliability, flexibility design or spatial structure optimization in dense freeway network under the condition of resource constraints in corridors.",Dense freeway network;resource-constrained corridors;topology model;algorithm of bin geometry;data structure,,"Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"

This new vehicle, which is a successor to the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), is called the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV). With several unique aspects of the Lunar South Pole region, the LTV will have a different vehicle configuration from the LRV in respect to suit interfaces, cockpit layout, hand controllers, seats, and translation aids. In addition to replicating the capabilities provided by the LRV, the LTV design will expand functionality in areas such as being reusable with a service life of approximately 10 years, ability to survive eclipse periods and periods of shadow, remote operations, ability to traverse uncrewed to points of interest, and interface with and/or deploy future science instruments or payloads. This paper discusses the first in a series of design testing for the LTV concept. The objective of the test protocol was to gather a preliminary understanding of a reference concept design and collect data, using an unpressurized/mockup suit, on all aspects and devices used for driving and operating the LTV with limited suit mobility. Specifically, the team evaluated suited ingress/egress on/off the vehicle, two seat design options (“Apollo Style Inspired” and “Leaning Post”), footrest placement, controller assembly design and usability, and protocols for more advanced testing. Using six engineering subjects with an anthropometric stature range of 30th percentile female to 98th percentile male, results indicated the volume of the LTV deck to ingress/egress was acceptable regardless of seat configuration. Side horizontal translations aids were acceptable with vertical aids needed near the seats. Of the two seat designs, the Apollo Inspired seat was easier to get into a seated position, more comfortable, and needed less adjustments when compared to the Leaning Post configuration. Both seat designs needed improved back adjustability to perform better testing resulting in improved recommendations on true seat angle. A major finding was additional volume needed between seated crewmembers' shoulders and arms to operate the vehicle safely and eliminate interference caused by the other crewmember. More design maturity was desirable in the footrest design and additional adjustability in all axes was required for the controller assemblies. Based on preliminary evaluation data collected from this study, the team will refine seat adjustability and arm rest spacing, add additional translation aids, test two ingress/egress strategies (front entry versus side entry), collect suited seated functional reach data, collect suited seated field-of-view (FOV) data, and retest the protocol in a pressurized planetary suit.",,,"NASA/Leidos Incorporated, Houston, TX; NASA/Aerospace, Houston, TX; NASA/GeoControls, Houston, TX; NASA/JES Tech, Houston, TX; NASA/KBR, Houston, TX; NASA/JES Tech, Houston, TX; NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX; NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX"

However, most pipe-climbing robots are designed for specific applications with complex structures; this limits the adaptability to various conditions. To solve this issue, this letter presents a one-piece 3D-printed pipe-climbing robot composed of sequenced novel soft bending mechanisms. The mechanisms use the small strains of soft materials to achieve large bending deformation. The proposed robot is highly adaptable to pipes with various diameters, radii of curvature, inclinations, and even outer/inner walls because of modular grippers and an inchworm inspired middle section. The good strength and flexibility of the robot are simultaneously achieved by reasonable structural design using one material. In this letter, the design concept and processing methods are introduced. The finite element method is adopted to predict the maximum bending angle of modules to aid design, and a torque test bench is built to acquire output torque and restoring torque. Then, the model of the entire robot is built to facilitate specialized design. Finally, several experiments are conducted to verify the good adaptability of the robot to pipes of various diameters (18-36 mm), inclinations (0-90°, even horizontal pipes), and radii of curvature (minimum to 19 mm).

The feasibility of implementation of the training protocol was tested in stroke patients only, who practiced a series of exercises concurrently to music sequences produced by specific movements. The assessment protocol evaluated hand motor performance during pronation/supination, wrist horizontal flexion/extension, and hand grasp without sonification. From hand position data, 15 quantitative parameters were computed evaluating mean velocity, movement smoothness, and angular excursions of hand/fingers. We validated this assessment in terms of its ability to discriminate between patients and healthy subjects, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity with the upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer scale (FM), the functional independence measure (FIM), and the Box and Block Test (BBT). All patients showed a good understanding of the assigned tasks and were able to correctly execute the proposed training protocol, confirming its feasibility. A moderate-to-excellent intraclass correlation coefficient was found in 8/15 computed parameters. The moderate-to-strong correlation was found between the measured parameters and the clinical scales.

Qiu,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,8,"Accurate measurement of drill bit position and direction is the main technology to realize automation and intelligence in oil drilling field. In recent years, with the rapid development of complex drilling technologies such as high deviation wells, directional wells and horizontal wells, higher requirements have been put forward for measurement technology, especially for real-time monitoring of bit attitude and position during the drilling process. Therefore, for the past few years, the measurement while drilling (MWD) system has been widely recognized and developed rapidly in precision targeted drilling. among them, strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) consisting of accelerometer and gyroscope is the key of down-hole measurement while drilling. To solve the problem of accumulated errors in SINS, in this paper, a positioning error correction method based on kinematic constraint-aided (KC) SINS zero velocity updated (ZUPT) model is proposed. Firstly, based on the acceleration and angular velocity information measured by SINS, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet de-noising reconstruction are performed for MWD signals. Secondly, the static detection model of the drill bit is established by using the reconstructed signal. Thirdly, using drilling technology to analyze the motion attitude of the bit, the KC model of the down-hole bit is established. By analysis the alternating effect of the KC model and the ZUPT model in the process of the bit movement and stop, the ZUPT model of the SINS is established. Finally, experimental verification is performed by building a drilling platform. The experimental results show that the maximum positioning error of the proposed positioning model is 0.15 m within 300 s. Comparing with a single KC model and a single ZUPT model, the bit positioning accuracy is improved to 92.6%, which effectively suppresses the original cumulative error, and verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.",Measurement while drilling system;strap-down inertial navigation system;empirical mode decomposition;kinematic constraint-aided;zero velocity updated,,"School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China"

Toxiri; G. Chini; C. D. Natali; D. G. Caldwell; J. Ortiz,2022,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,IEEE Journals,8,"Shoulder-sideWINDER is an exoskeleton to assist the shoulder movement of workers performing manual tasks. It aims to minimize discomfort caused by a joint misalignment between the shoulder and an exoskeleton, which is a common problem with many closely coupled systems. Based on the shoulder’s musculoskeletal structure, we propose two novel misalignment correction mechanisms: center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and force-guiding mechanism. The center-of-rotation tracking mechanism compensates for the vertical misalignment that arises from the scapulohumeral rhythm. The force-guiding mechanism compensates for the horizontal misalignment due to changes in the plane of the arm elevation. The kinematic performance of reducing joint misalignment was evaluated using the angle ratio as the indicator under two conditions: with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism. The muscle load caused by the kinematic disturbance was evaluated under three conditions: wearing the exoskeleton with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and not wearing the exoskeleton. The analysis used muscle load data measured by surface electromyography on five shoulder muscles. Five subjects executed 12 arm motions each, in 4 planes of elevation. Since the system was optimized for a pilot user, subjects with similar morphology presented positive results showing that the proposed mechanism reduced the misalignment in the dominant range of working motion. Apart from the anterior deltoid, the loads on muscles responsible for the dominant range of working motion also showed a significant reduction compared to the case without the mechanism. In conclusion, we verified that the Shoulder-sideWINDER provides comfortable support by reducing joint misalignment, and identified directions for design improvements that will further enhance usability.",Human-centered robotics;mechanism design;performance evaluation and benchmarking;wearable robots,,"Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy; Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy; Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy; Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy; Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy; Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"

Even with multimodal sensor fusion, accurately and reliably estimating grasp poses for complex-shaped objects remains a challenge. In this paper, we design a vision-based grasping platform for a more general case, that is, grasping a variety of objects by a simple parallel gripper with the grasp detection model consuming RGB sensing or depth sensing. Focusing on the grasp pose estimation part, we propose a deep grasp detector that uses a densely connected Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) feature extractor and multiple two-stage detection units to achieve dense grasp pose predictions. Specifically, for the feature extractor, the fusion of different layer feature maps can increase both the model’s capacity to detect the various size grasp areas and the accuracy of the regressed grasp positions. For each of the two-stage detection unit, the first stage generates horizontal candidate grasp areas, while the second stage refines them to predict the rotated grasp poses. We train and validate our grasp pose estimation algorithm on the Cornell Grasp Dataset and the Jacquard Dataset. The model achieves the detection accuracy of 93.3% and 89.6%, respectively. We further design real-world grasp experiments to verify the effectiveness of our vision-based robotic grasping system.

1863,Integration of GNSS Precise Point Positioning and Reduced Inertial Sensor System for Lane-Level Car Navigation,M. Elsheikh; A. Noureldin; M. Korenberg,2022,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,IEEE Journals,8,"The last decade has witnessed a growing demand for precise positioning in many applications, including autonomous car navigation. The safety features in autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require lane-level positioning accuracy. Such accuracy can be obtained from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) through either differential techniques or Precise Point Positioning (PPP). PPP is currently favored over differential GNSS because it provides a global solution without the need for local reference stations. Nevertheless, employing PPP for land vehicles would be challenging due to frequent signal degradation and blockage. Integrating PPP with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) can solve the solution continuity problem; however, the INS solution drifts over time, resulting in losing the desired accuracy. Implementing a reliable PPP/INS system that can preserve the required accuracy is not trivial, especially with financial and computational cost constraints. This article proposes the integration of PPP with the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) for lane-level car navigation. The high-precision needed in lane-level positioning can be achieved by integrating PPP with high-end INS. Since high-end INS are expensive, this work proposes the use of RISS instead of the traditional INS. RISS uses only one gyroscope and two accelerometers, which can save more than half the high-end INS cost. The proposed PPP/RISS system was tested through three road tests that included highway driving under several overpasses.

Lo,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,7,"The use of the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) as a source of alternative positioning, navigation, and timing is attractive as the system has been or soon will be fielded. In this study, a wide-area multilateration (WAM) testbed was developed that implements a time difference of arrival (TDOA) positioning algorithm using the 1090 MHz ADS-B Mode S ES signal in the Taiwan area. The positioning performance of the TDOA-based WAM is influenced by the geometric distribution of ground stations. Common requirements for terrestrial navigation systems target nominal horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) of 2.828 or lower to support aviation navigation and surveillance [1]-[7]. Meeting such a requirement would necessitate a significant and geometrically diverse number of stations which limits the WAM implementation in countries with limited real estate. It also makes implementation expensive in general. Provided the measurements have adequate accuracy, it is still possible to meet position accuracy targets without such a geometry requirement. However, reducing geometry requirements presents issues with regards to developing a reliable and accurate position solution. This paper proposes a reasonable means of providing an accurate solution given limited station availability and demonstrates the concept in a testbed system implemented in Taiwan. In order to provide more reliable solution, a positioning algorithm is proposed that combines iterative and non-iterative methods to provide reliable convergence to the near optimal solution given the available measurements and the addition of barometric altitude from ADS-B to improve geometry.

Ground source heat pumps, commonly referred to as geothermal heat pumps, are extremely efficient systems that pull heat from the earth’s surface. Traditional heating and cooling systems can be replaced with ground source heat pump (GSHP) technology. The purpose of this research is to develop and analyze the feasibility of GSHP in Bangladesh. The research study discovered that by utilizing GSHP, the emission factor can be reduced by 3.1 tCO2/Mwh per year. The utilization of green energy contributes to a clean environment. Besides this study employs a horizontal axis closed-loop heat exchanger, which reduces the system’s total cost. The proposed system has a lower initial and operating cost than a conventional power system. The study concluded that the system will generate revenue for the authority within five years of its implementation. Thus, it is financially viable and low-cost to operate. Additionally, global warming is accelerating, and summer temperatures are increasing dramatically. As a result of this research, a green energy-based system will be developed that will be more efficient for Bangladesh.

Kassas,2020,"2020 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)",IEEE Conferences,3,"Path planning for a ground vehicle in an urban environment is considered. The vehicle is equipped with a GPS receiver and a road map. The vehicle desires to take the shortest path to reach a target destination, while guaranteeing that integrity monitoring-based measures are satisfied along its traversed path. A path planning algorithm is proposed that yields the optimal path to follow as well as suboptimal feasible paths. The integrity monitoring-based measure considered in this paper is the horizontal protection level (HPL), which refers to the statistical bound around the vehicle that guarantees the probability of the absolute position error exceeding a desired threshold is not larger than the integrity risk. Experimental results are presented showing that choosing the optimal path from the proposed algorithm reduces the average and maximum HPL by 2 m and 20.2 m, respectively, compared to choosing the shortest-time path, while introducing a negligible additional path length.",Navigation;ground vehicle;integrity;receiver autonomous integrity monitoring;path planning;GPS,,"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Irvine, U.S.A.; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Irvine, U.S.A."

Ludvigsen,2020,2020 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Symposium (AUV),IEEE Conferences,2,"In-situ measurements under the sea-ice are important to understand the rapid climate changes that are occurring in the Arctic region. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are suited for this application due to its large spatial and temporal coverage and resolution. However, AUV operations under sea-ice in the Arctic are especially challenging due to degraded navigation, limited communication, and the inability to return to the surface during the mission. This paper presents an intelligent buoy network designed to aid AUV navigation during operations under the ice. The navigation buoys are equipped with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and acoustic modems that are used to communicate with the AUV. A Single Transponder Navigation (STN) algorithm designed by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) and Kongsberg Maritime (KM) named Underwater Transponder Positioning (UTP) is used to update the AUVs navigation system during the mission. In addition to the design of the buoys, the paper presents a non-singular horizontal position representation called n-vector and its use for ice-relative guidance and navigation. The method is verified through a simulation study using the FFI/KM navigation processing suite, NavLab, where the drift of the buoys are based on ice drift data from a simulation and forecasting tool for AUVs. The simulations show that the UTP algorithm with moving transponders has low errors for all the tested measurement rates due to high-end inertial navigation. For the lowest tested UTP update rate of 1/120 Hz the RMS errors for x and y-positions are 1.02 m and 1.96 m, respectively, with corresponding standard deviations of 1.00 m and 1.81 m.",Autonomous underwater vehicle;underwater navigation;Arctic technology;networked vehicles,,"Dept. of Marine Technology, Norwegian Univ. of Sci. and Tech.

In order to investigate the suggested engineering solution we developed a 3D model of a microwave polarization converter with 5 corner diaphragms in the form of square conducting plates located in the diagonally opposite corners of the square waveguide. Numerical simulations were carried out using efficient finite elements method in the frequency domain. The structure of a polarization converter was developed for the satellite operating frequency band 19-21 GHz. Optimized design of the polarizer provides VSWR less than 1.5 for vertical and horizontal polarizations of fundamental electromagnetic modes. Peak level of numerically simulated cross polarization isolation is less than -30 dB in the whole operating frequency band.

The classical GPS / INS integrated navigation scheme continues navigation by IMU in the case of GPS distortion such as satellite navigation signal occlusion, but the error accumulation of low-cost inertial navigation devices will occur over time. Therefore, an integrated navigation system with two modes is proposed: GPS / INS combination with satellite navigation information and INS / Speedometer combination without satellite navigation information, so as to avoid the large error of pure inertial navigation mode. The measured data show that the maximum horizontal error of the algorithm is less than 6m in the case of GPS short-time lock loss (<40s), which meets the requirements of short-time positioning accuracy. In urban vehicle driving environment, the adaptive Kalman filter algorithm and vehicle dynamics constraints are applied to the navigation filter algorithm, with an aim to improve the accuracy of integrated navigation.

Different from TBSs, however, UAV access points (UAPs) are of high mobility in horizontal and vertical dimensions, which may deteriorate the coverage performance. Worsestill, the mobility of UAPs would as well increase the pressure of wireless backhaul. In this light, we investigate the performance of the cache-enabled UAV communications network (CUCN) in terms of network spatial throughput (ST) by analyzing the line of sight (LoS) connections and non-line of sight (NLoS) connections. It is found that the network ST is exponentially decreased with the square of UAP altitude. Furthermore, contrary to intuition, a large cache size may deteriorate the network ST when UAPs are over-deployed. The reason is that a large cache size increases the hit probability, which may increase the activation of UAPs and consequently result in complicated interference. Aiming to maximize the network ST, we optimize the cache strategy under limited backhaul. Remarkably, the results show that network ST could be substantially improved by the optimized cache strategy and the performance degeneration brought by UAP high mobility could be even eliminated especially when the UAP altitude is high.",caching optimization;UAV communications network;spatial throughput;stochastic geometry;aerial access point,,"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"

UAVs organized as a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) can process jobs received by ground devices through vertical offload. Moreover, the load among UAVs can be balanced by leveraging the horizontal offload among the UAVs in the FANET, with the aim of reducing the processing delay. However, offloading decisions inside a FANET have to be dynamically adapted to the current state of the FANET and the number of job requests coming from the underlying geographical area. As the number of UAVs in the FANET increases, many Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches fall short to achieve reasonable performance due to the exponential increase in the action space. For this reason, in this paper we propose a framework to manage the FANET using DRL and compare the performance of both centralized single-agent and distributed multi-agent approaches to choose the best offloading probabilities to forward incoming jobs to neighboring UAVs.",6G;UAVs;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Management Framework,,"University of Catania, CNIT Research Unit, Catania, Italy; University of Catania, CNIT Research Unit, Catania, Italy; University of Catania, CNIT Research Unit, Catania, Italy"

However, the conventional foot-mounted IPNS that generally relies only on zero-velocity update (ZUPT) has serious heading drift and incorrectly judges foot as still phases when pedestrians take moving platforms (MPs; such as elevators and escalators). In this article, with the aid of six low-cost inertial sensors, a bipedal equality constraint method based on the Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) model is constructed to reduce heading drift. Then, an MP correction model that fuses detection, motion substates classification, and corresponding velocity constraint of MPs is proposed to achieve precise position tracking during elevator or escalator rides. Based on the equality constraint, the heading of the system is more accurate, which gives better play to the performance of the MP correction model. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified by multiple experiments in an office building, the positioning error in the rectangular 2-D experiment is less than 0.3%, and the horizontal positioning error and height positioning error in the comprehensive 3-D experiment are both less than 0.8%.",Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) model;equality constraint;inertial pedestrian navigation;moving platform (MP) correction model,,"College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; School of Railway Transportation, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China; College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"

However, the coupling between the DOV and the horizontal attitude errors will induce significate measurement errors of DOV. In order to improve the accuracy of the DOV measurement, a new algorithm based on the observation of the rotational inertial navigation system (RINS) and GNSS integration attitude errors is proposed. Firstly, an attitude reference decoupled from DOV is constructed with the raw gyroscope data of the INS. Then, the attitude error of the RINS/GNSS integration, which is directly induced by the DOV signal, is obtained when compared with the attitude reference. Thirdly, DOV and various systematic errors including attitude reference error and inertial sensor errors are accurately modeled. The long-wavelength components of DOV are given by global gravity model, and the short-wavelength components are modeled as derivative second-order Gauss-Markov processes. Finally, DOV and systematic errors are simultaneously estimated by a Kalman smoother with the observation of RINS/GNSS attitude error. A ship-borne survey campaign deploying three RINS/GNSS integrated systems is conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the internal accuracy of the DOV measurement can reach better than 0.25″(1σ).

First, they either ignore the original information of bitemporal images or insufficiently utilize the difference information between bitemporal images, which leads to the low tightness of the changed objects. Second, Siamese CNNs always employ dual-branch encoders for CD, which increases computational cost. To address the above issues, this article proposes a network based on difference enhancement and spatial–spectral nonlocal (DESSN) for CD in very-high-resolution (VHR) images. This article makes threefold contributions. First, we design a difference enhancement (DE) module that can effectively learn the difference representation between foreground and background to reduce the impact of irrelevant changes on the detection results. Second, we present a spatial–spectral nonlocal (SSN) module that is different from vanilla nonlocal because multiscale spatial global features are incorporated to model the large-scale variation of objects during CD. The module can be used to strengthen the edge integrity and internal tightness of changed objects. Third, the asymmetric double convolution with Ghost (ADCG) module is exploited instead of standard convolution. The ADCG can not only refine the edge information of the changed objects, since horizontal and vertical convolutional kernels have good contour preservation advantages, but also greatly reduce the computational complexity of the proposed model. The experiments on two public VHR CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed network can provide higher detection accuracy and requires smaller memory usage than state-of-the-art networks.",Change detection (CD);difference enhancement (DE) module;Siamese convolutional neural networks (CNNs);spatial-spectral nonlocal (SSN) module,,"Shaanxi Joint Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and the School of Electronic Information and Artificial Intelligence, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an, China; School of Electronical and Control Engineering, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an, China; School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Joint Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and the School of Electronic Information and Artificial Intelligence, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an, China; School of Electronical and Control Engineering, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an, China; School of Computer Science and the School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China; Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, U.K."

Jiang,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,6,"Pneumonia is a relatively common disease that will endanger the lives of patients if left untreated. End-to-end detection of pneumonia using neural networks will be helpful for reducing related workforce. CNN's processing of images shows remarkable performance, naturally, the use of CNN based methods for assisted reading will be a trend in modern medicine. The property of current detection algorithms is not yet satisfactory, so further research is extremely needed. In this article, we design GeminiNet to identify and localize the pneumonia in Chest X-ray (CXR) images. It uses a popular fully convolution architecture with computation shared on the entire image, combining RoI Align and PSRoI Pooling to capture global and local information and output. Our approach introduces DetNet59, a network designed specifically for detection to capture deep features. In the sixth stage of DetNet59, the structure of the retina-like convolutional layers is added to replace the fully connected layer. This structure uses the dilated convolution to extend the reconstructive field, and the convolution kernels of three different scales are used for parallel calculation to collect rich feature information. GeminiNet is validated on the RSNA dataset. We augment dataset by flipping on horizontal and vertical for the small amount of data.

To realize the potential of ITS applications, data exchange should be efficiently carried out through direct communication over short distances both between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). High demands are placed on ITS performance indicators. These requirements are increasing especially in the context of the new mobility patterns using autonomous vehicles. The ITS big data processing can be centralized or distributed. The centralized approach utilizes the power of cloud computing. In contrast to cloud computing, intelligent data processing with faster responses and higher quality can be provided by fog computing. Fog computing is a horizontal, system-level architecture that distributes computing, storage, control and networking functions closer to the users along a cloud-to-thing continuum.

Currently, design IC house and Semiconductor industry face the limit of Moore’s Law including the challenge of low wafer yield but high wafer cost for advanced SoC wafer preparion. To get higher wafer yield with low cost saving, design IC house prefer to use chiplet to separate function to muti-chips. In order to connect different functional chips and improve the electrical transmission between chips, the heterogeneous/ homogeneous integration package types as chiplet integrated idea come out and become popular, these package can used TSI ( through silicon via interposer), Fan-out Redistribution Layer (FORDL) or Embedded bridge die (EB) as die connection. 2.5D package with a through silicon via interposer is the most popular and already production in market. Based on published HPC products on the market, the package trend are integrated more HBM or die, larger package size with dissipation capacity. The 2.5D disadvantage are high TSI cost and low yield of TSI wafer and complex MEOL (middle end of line) process flow. IC design houses are looking for alterative package of 2.5D to support large chip module package.In this paper, structure is used FORDL (Fan-out Redistribution Layer) structure with small embedded bridge die as signal horizontal connection between die, and TMV (through mold via) structure for vertical connection, this structure is no need complex MEOL process. By using molding interposer to replace silicon interposer will help to control chip module warpage because smaller CTE mismatch with substrate. But there is a thermal concern for FOEB structure, because molding thermal capability is worse than silicon wafer. In this paper, we demonstrate two solution to enhance FOEB package thermal capability to reach end product request. One solution is build thick TMV to replace fine TSV (through silicon via) structure. By selecting suitable Dry film and optimized Litho process, there is no photoresist residue or TMV crack in cross-section. It has thicker RDL and larger diameter TMV are benefit to power ground preference and transmission of electrical signals.

Sharma,2020,2020 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),IEEE Conferences,0,"NINo is a future DevOps / Data Science pipeline tool that is being developed by JHU APL and two ASPIRE interns. The goal of this capability is to expose function-level capabilities, via either a simple application or configuration file, for use in Docker [1], Serverless Architectures [2], or data science/analytic pipelines. The goal is similar to efforts such as Metaparticle [3] and Source-to-Image[4] that aim to lower the barrier to horizontal scaling of data processing and analysis capabilities. In previous years ASPIRE interns have developed tools to ease the acceptance of DevOps principles in JHU APL. They have created a web application, Harmonia, that asked users a few simple questions and supplied the scaffolding for a software project with artifacts to support sound software engineering processes. The lack of user interest has driven us to a more focused objective. NINo will focus on easing deployment to cloud environments. Ideally, any person could develop cloud-based data science services. The team and its work has been organized in an asynchronous and agile manner. There have been three members working on three subsystems: configuration, framework/integration, and artifact generation. An incremental and prototype-driven approach has allowed for creation of increasingly more functional software as internship has proceeded. Interns have been given extensive control over their development processes and have investigated the programming frameworks used. While the initial stages have not resulted in a complete system, the interns have improved their programming skills and complete common coding challenges. The team is close to integration testing and initial demonstration. As the academic year closes, team members will work on design improvement, refactoring, and generation of future feature requests from prospective users. One summer intern will focus on developing a user interface for configuring and observing results.",,,NA; NA; NA

The specific feature of this equipment is single shaft configuration, thus gas and steam turbine, as well as common generator, is located in one single shaft. The transition from the installation of the system “turboset-foundation-ground” (TFG) to its continuous exploitation leads to the change of relative position of its rotor supports (bearings) especially in the condition of permafrost soil. The change in relative position of bearings involves the change of rotor centers: opening of coupling halves and their relative displacement in circle. Irregular displacement of rotor bearings in vertical section leads to the horizontal change of rotor centres. The purpose of the paper is to carry out the rotor centering of turboset using geodetic data. In the process of start-up and adjustment operations it is required to adjust spatial position of the basic parts of the steam and gas-turbine set to project specified values. In order to do this it is strongly required to follow thoroughly the order of the geodetic measurement and to control the project-specified position of the major parts of the steam and gas-turbine set in such a way, that the mounting of its separate parts would be provided with the geodetic error not more than 0,08-0,10 MM. The paper provides the calculation of rotor centre change according to geodetic data. In order to obtain the rotor change values there were carried out the cycles of high-accuracy leveling based on the marks, located on the bearings, and 3D model of foundation plate and shaft line after the mounting of the turboset had been completed The given method of rotors' alignment was tested in the construction and exploitation of three power complexes PGU - 420 of the Nygan power plant, total capacity 1080 MW.",turboset;tacheometer;the accuracy;the reflecting plate;the rotors centering,,"Head of Department Engineering Surveying and Mining Geodesy, Siberian State University of Geosystems and Technologies, lNovosibirsk, Russia; Head of Department Engineering Surveying and Mining Geodesy, Siberian State University of Geosystems and Technologies, Novosibirsk, Russia"

Firstly, considering time-varying calibration errors of inertial sensors, a novel robust posterior filtering equation in Krein space is designed to improve the matching degree between the physical process and the mathematical model. Moreover, combined with the multiple forward and reverse navigation processes, an adaptive calculation times control method in backtracking UKF based on the innovation is constructed to solve the nonlinear fast alignment problem in the case of large misalignment angle errors with the purpose of further intelligently shortening the alignment time and ensuring alignment accuracy simultaneously in different periods and working environments.

The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite laser altimeter system is the first Chinese formal spaceborne laser altimeter system, which is equipped with laser footprint cameras for the first time. Given the very high height accuracy and high planimetric accuracy of the instrument, this letter proposed an adjustment method of ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imagery by integrating GF-7 laser altimetry data. The laser control points (LCPs) were automatically extracted according to the registration of the footprint images and stereo images. Furthermore, the combined adjustment was performed with the LCPs as the vertical control and horizontal constraint. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using 417 stereo scenes of ZY-3 images and 954 LCPs, covering an area of 158 000 km2 in Shandong, China. The results demonstrated that, only by using all LCPs as the vertical control, the root mean square error (RMSE) of elevation can be significantly improved from the original 8.82 to 1.40 m.

Nakashima,2023,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,IEEE Journals,6,"Artificial intelligence is used for various applications and is promising as an indispensable infrastructure in future societies. Neural networks are representative technologies that imitate human brains and exhibit various advantages. However, the size is bulky, the power is huge, and some advantages are not demonstrated because they are executed on Neumann-type computers. Neuromorphic systems are biomimetic systems from the hardware level to implement neuron and synapse elements, and the size is compact, the power is low, and the operation is robust. However, because the conventional ones are not composed of fully optimized hardware, the power is not yet minimal, and extra control circuits must be used. In this article, we developed a neuromorphic system using memcapacitors and autonomous local learning. By using memcapacitors, the power can be minimal, and by using autonomous local learning, the control circuits to handle the synapse elements can be deleted. First, the memcapacitors are completed in a cross-bar array, where the ferroelectric layers are sandwiched between the horizontal and perpendicular electrodes. The polarization and capacitance exhibit hysteresis due to the dielectric polarization. Next, autonomous local learning is introduced as follows. During the training phase, associative patterns to be memorized are directly sent, relatively high voltages are applied, and dielectric polarizations are induced. During the operation phase, relatively low voltages are applied, and input signals are weighted with the capacitances of the memcapacitors, summed, and transferred as the output signals. Finally, the experimental system is set up, and the experimental results are acquired. The memorized patterns during the training phase, distorted patterns as the input signals during the operation phase, and retrieved patterns as the output signals in the operation phase are shown.

1929,Automatic Extraction of Seismic Data Horizon Across Faults,J. Li; W. Huang,2022,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,1,"Most of the traditional horizon interpretation methods are based on the dip of the seismic data. Since the dip does not correctly reflect the discontinuous reflection characteristics of the events, these methods usually cannot extract the horizons containing faults well. Meanwhile, the field seismic data observed in complex areas are generally with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes the extraction of horizons difficult. To address these problems, an automatic horizon extraction approach under fault control is investigated in this article. First, the horizon dip is obtained by using plane wave destruction (PWD), and the dip information can be utilized to control the overall trend of the horizon curve. Based on the dip information, we can also calculate the weight coefficients to characterize the faults. The fault characterization results can better guide the horizon extraction. Then, the dynamic time warping (DTW) is used for phase matching to further obtain the similar slope and describe the details of the horizontal curve. Finally, the horizon extraction equation is developed with the dip and phase information as the guide and solved iteratively to obtain the final horizon curve. The effectiveness of the presented approach is tested by both synthetic and field data. The results demonstrate that the presented approach can accurately pick the horizon information across faults and is more stable in the condition of low SNR compared with previous methods.",Automatic extraction;dynamic time warping (DTW);fault identification;local similarity;seismic horizon interpretation,,"State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Beijing, China"

Ohashi,2023,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"Magnetic bearing is used in flywheel energy storage system and can address energy loss at contact points in rotating because a rotor can be supported without contact points. However, in order to keep a rotor levitating, a control system is required. The HTS magnetic bearing levitates the rotor by pinning force without a control system and of a rotor including permanent magnets and a HTS. The vertical oscillation of the rotor is suppressed because the flux is interlinked to the outside of the HTS. Therefore, the rotor oscillates in the horizontal direction in rotating. This oscillation generates the flux variation on the HTS surface and it decreases the number of revolutions. This paper proposes an analysis of flux variation on the HTS surface by the oscillation of HTS magnetic bearing rotor. The effect of the oscillation of the rotor on the number of revolutions is shown by the analysis of the flux variation of the HTS. In the analysis results, the amount of flux variation increased rapidly because the rotor increases the oscillation. The flux variation causes a decrease the in number of revolutions and the small oscillations cause flux variation on the HTS surface. However, the decrease in the number of revolutions is small because the amount of the flux variation is small.",Flywheel;High-temperature superconductor;Magnetic bearing;Permanent magnet;Pinning force,,"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kansai University Suita, Osaka, Japan; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kansai University Suita, Osaka, Japan; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kansai University Suita, Osaka, Japan; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kansai University Suita, Osaka, Japan"

1934,Dynamic Modeling and Controllability Analysis of a Moderately Damaged Unmanned Aerial System,A. McKinnis; S. Keshmiri,2019,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,0,"This research presents dynamic modeling and controllability analysis of a moderately damaged Viking-400 unmanned aerial system. In absence of flight test data, changes in longitudinal and lateral-directional dynamic modes of this aircraft due to asymmetric damage are investigated using Athena Vortex Lattice. Dynamic modeling of damaged aircraft has not been studied extensively. The majority of existing works are based on research conducted at NASA Langley, which used wind tunnel experiments on a 5.5%-scale model of generic transport aircraft. Only a few studies have examined onboard adverse impacts on the dynamic model of damaged UASs and most of these studies used extremely simple approaches to reflect changes in the UAS dynamic by manipulating stability and control derivatives based on perceived impact of damage. In this work, two major cases with different extents of damage are considered. Main scenarios are: (1) wing tip loss with partial aileron loss (2) damage to the horizontal tail and elevator. Damages are assumed to be asymmetric, inflicted by man-portable air defense systems. Uniquely, a methodology is created to document the changes in moment of inertia and aircraft geometry. Utilizing AVL, stability and control derivatives were developed at the aircraft's cruise velocity of 60 knots for each damage condition. Modal analyses are conducted for each scenario. Using linear time-invariant system representation of the UAS, a controllability analysis is also conducted for each scenario. The results of this analysis show that the aircraft is controllable for all damage scenario.",,,"University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS; University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS"
1935,MOBINN: Stair-Climbing Mobile Robot With Novel Flexible Wheels,G. Kim; H. Chung; B. -K. Cho,2023,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"With the recent advancements in delivery service robots, the necessity for stair climbing in indoor and outdoor environments has increased. However, stairs are challenging obstacles for robots to overcome. Most studies in the field of delivery robots have focused on traversing even terrains, such as roads and aisles. However, delivery service robots should be capable of climbing stairs in both indoor and outdoor environments. The main purpose of this study is to develop MOBINN, a mobile balancing robot that is capable of climbing stairs for delivery services. MOBINN has novel flexible wheels that can adapt to the shape of the stairs and reduce the torque needed for climbing them. Due to the advantages of flexible wheels, MOBINN can climb stairs without needing an additional degree of freedom. The head structure is designed to reduce damage to delivery packages as the robot maintains a horizontal orientation when climbing stairs. The design also includes an linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based motion controller and observer for stair climbing. This study experimentally verified that the novel flexible wheels lowered the required torque and enabled stable stair climbing.",Flexible structures;linear–quadratic control;observers,,"Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Kookmin, Seoul, South Korea; Mechanical Engineering Department, Hyundai Motors Research Center, Uiwang, South Korea; Robotics and Control Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"

Here, inspired by the motion principle of jellyfish, a novel piezoelectric pulsed-jet actuator (PJA) was proposed as the power source. Six PJAs were arranged crosswise to form an antihydropressure miniature cross-shaped underwater robot (CSUR) with dimensions of Φ10.9 × 6.3 cm3. The numerical simulation method was adopted to analyze the propulsion mechanism, optimize the structure, and find the optimal frequency. A robot prototype was fabricated, and its motion performances were tested. The CSUR achieved floating, sinking, and hovering motions in the vertical direction and linear, rotary, and turning motions in the horizontal direction. The maximum linear velocity reached up to 47.8 mm/s (0.43 BL/s). The robot could move in a high-pressure environment of 10 MPa, and the average velocity deviations under different water pressures were less than 10%. Besides, the CSUR could move along an S-shaped path to navigate around obstacles.

1937,Airborne Radar for sUAS Sense and Avoid,G. N. Szatkowski; A. Kriz; L. A. Ticatch; R. Briggs; J. Coggin; C. M. Morris,2019,2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),IEEE Conferences,6,"A primary challenge for the safe integration of small UAS operations into the National Airspace System (NAS) is traffic deconfliction, both from manned and unmanned aircraft. The UAS Traffic Management (UTM) project being conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) considers a layered approach to separation provision, ranging from segregation of operations through airspace volumes (geofences) to autonomous sense and avoid (SAA) technologies for higher risk, densely occupied airspace. Cooperative SAA systems, such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and/or vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems provide significant additional risk mitigation but they fail to adequately mitigate collision risks for non-cooperative (non-transponder equipped) airborne aircraft. The RAAVIN (Radar on Autonomous Aircraft to Verify ICAROUS Navigation) flight test being conducted by NASA and the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP) was designed to investigate the applicability and performance of a prototype, commercially available sUAS radar to detect and track non-cooperative airborne traffic, both manned and unmanned. The radar selected for this research was a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with 120 degree azimuth and 80 degree elevation field of view operating at 24.55GHz center frequency with a 200 MHz bandwidth. The radar transmits 2 watts of power thru a Metamaterial Electronically Scanning Array antenna in horizontal polarization. When the radar is transmitting, personnel must be at least 1 meter away from the active array to limit nonionizing radiation exposure. The radar physical dimensions are 18.7cm by 12.1cm by 4.1cm and it weighs less than 820 grams making it well suited for installation on small UASs. The onboard, SAA capability, known as ICAROUS, (Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems), developed by NASA to support sUAS operations, will provide autonomous guidance using the traffic radar tracks from the onboard radar. The RAAVIN set of studies will be conducted in three phases. The first phase included outdoor, ground-based radar evaluations performed at the Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm testing range in Blacksburg, VA. The test was designed to measure how well the radar could detect and track a small UAS flying in the radar's field of view. The radar was used to monitor 5 test flights consisting of outbound, inbound and crossing routes at different ranges and altitudes. The UAS flown during the ground test was the Inspire 2, a quad copter weighing less than 4250 grams (10 pounds) at maximum payload. The radar was set up to scan and track targets over its full azimuthal field of view from 0 to 40 degrees in elevation. The radar was configured to eliminate tracks generated from any targets located beyond 2000 meters from the radar and moving at velocities under 1.45 meters per second. For subsequent phases of the study the radar will be integrated with a sUAS platform to evaluate its performance in flight for SAA applications ranging from sUAS to manned GA aircraft detections and tracking. Preliminary data analysis from the first outdoor ground tests showed the radar performed well at tracking the vehicle as it flew outbound and repeatedly maintained a track out to 1000 meters (maximum 1387 meters) until the vehicle slowed to a stop to reverse direction to fly inbound. As the Inspire flew inbound tracks from beyond 800 meters, a reacquisition time delay was consistently observed between when the Inspire exceeds a speed of 1.45 meters per second and when the radar indicated an inbound target was present and maintained its track. The time delay varied between 6 seconds to over 37 seconds for the inbound flights examined, and typically resulted in about a 200 meter closure distance before the Inspire track was maintained. The radar performed well at both acquiring and tracking the vehicle as it flew crossing routes out past 400 meters across the azimuthal field of view. The radar and ICAROUS software will be integrated and flown on a BFD-1400-SE8-E UAS during the next phase of the RAAVIN project. The main goal at the conclusion of this effort is to determine if this radar technology can reliably support minimum requirements for SAA applications of sUAS. In particular, the study will measure the range of vehicle detections, lateral and vertical angular errors, false and missed/late detections, and estimated distance at closest point of approach after an avoidance maneuver is executed. This last metric is directly impacted by sensor performance and indicates its suitability for the task.",UTM;SAA;Radar;UAS,,"NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va, USA; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Va, USA; TEAMS III, Hampton, VA, USA; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Va, USA; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Va, USA; Analytical Mechanics Associates, Hampton, VA, USA"

However, the positioning of UAVs is a critical problem that affects both the coverage performance and energy consumption. In this work, considering a heterogeneous set of UAVs acting as aerial mmWave BSs, we develop an effective approach for the 3D positioning of the UAVs that leads to maximum coverage area with minimal power consumption. The UAVs have a varying transmit power and flight altitude range. Given a repository of UAVs, the proposed method finds an optimal subset of the available UAVs and determines their 3D position for maximum LOS coverage area with minimum energy consumption. First, we formulate an optimization problem to find the best subset of available UAVs along with their horizontal position. Next, we optimize the altitude of the UAVs based on the practical data of the geographical environment, such as the number and location of the buildings and other structures.

Tadokoro,2022,2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),IEEE Conferences,0,"Drop mitigation is an important function of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) that are used for internal inspections of enclosed and cluttered structures (height: 5–10 m). The mechanism also allows continuous operation of drones, prevents the downtime required for maintenance and repair and also provides a safer environment for workers who are working below the drones. Some solutions include parachutes, auto-rotors, and active auto-rotors. However, these are inapplicable to MAV s with a protector shell because of their size and payload. We herein propose a new rapid response drop mitigation method for MA V s involving active autorotation with bendable wings and shells. Active autorotation enables faster deceleration during dropping motion as compared to parachutes or passive autorotation. Bendable wings can ensure optimal flight performance and enable sufficient deceleration during falling motion. This newly proposed fixture was shown to reduce the impact impulse by 32.2 % and horizontal oscillation by 34.4 %. From our flight tests conducted at heights of 5 m and 10m in both outdoor and indoor environments, the measured impact impulse for both profiles were attained at 0.93 N s. The minimum impact impulse that can cause harm to the human eye, which is the most vulnerable part, is 2 N s. Thus, this mechanism was successfully proven to provide a greater safety buffer based on the drop test conducted. We envision this mechanism to provide greater safety to drone operating environments in relevant fields involving indoor and urban drone flights.

We use a dense set of accurate ground coordinates obtained by kinematic Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) observations. Between 2001 and 2019, 148 surveys were made, at a 1 s sampling rate, along highways, roads, and tracks, with a total traveled distance of ∼25 000 km. The data are processed with the online Canadian Spatial Reference System precise point positioning software. From the output files, we select 885 252 coordinates from epochs with theoretical uncertainty below 0.1 m in horizontal and 0.2 m in vertical. Using specific calibration surveys, we estimate the mean vertical accuracy of the GNSS coordinates at 0.2 m. Resampling the DEM by a factor of 10 allows one to compare it with the GNSS in pixels of metric size, smaller than the width of the roads, even the small trails. The best fit is obtained by shifting the DEM by 0.47 ± 0.03 m upward, 0.10 ± 0.1 m westward, and 0.36 ± 0.1 m southward. Those values are 20 times below the nominal resolution of the DEM. Once the shift is corrected, the root mean square deviation between TanDEM-X DEM and GNSS elevations is 1.125 m. In forest and urban areas, the shift between the DEM and the GNSS increases by ∼0.5 m.

Gu,2022,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,IEEE Journals,32,"Although many soft robots, capable of crawling or climbing, have been well developed, integrating multimodal locomotion into a soft robot for transitioning between crawling and climbing still remains elusive. In this work, we present a class of inchworm-inspired multimodal soft crawling-climbing robots (SCCRs) that can achieve crawling, climbing, and transitioning between horizontal and vertical planes. Inspired by the inchworm’s multimodal locomotion, which depends on the “$\Omega$” deformation of the body and controllable friction force of feet, we develop the SCCR by 1) three pneumatic artificial muscles based body designed to produce “$\Omega$” deformation; 2) two negative pressure suckers adopted to generate controllable friction forces. Then a simplified kinematic model is developed to characterize the kinematic features of the SCCRs. Lastly, a control strategy is proposed to synchronously control the “$\Omega$” deformation and sucker friction forces for multimodal locomotion. The experimental results demonstrate that the SCCR can move at a maximum speed of 21 mm/s (0.11 body length/s) on horizontal planes and 15 mm/s (0.079 body length/s) on vertical walls.

1948,Stabilization System of AUV for Implementation of Contact Manipulation Operations,A. Konoplin; N. Krasavin; R. Vasilenko,2023,2023 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon),IEEE Conferences,0,"The paper describes an approach to the synthesis of automatic hover mode stabilization systems of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) equipped with multilink manipulators (MM). The proposed approach involves the installation of an additional thruster on the AUV. This thruster is located above the AUV center of the buoyancy on the outrigger rod in such a way that the thrust formed by the thruster is directed along the transverse horizontal axis of the vehicle. This expands the original propulsion and steering complex (PSC) and allows to compensate for the effects from the MM that cause the displacements of the AUV along the roll angle. Based on the features of the thrusters layout scheme, control signals of the extended PSC are generated to compensate for the dynamic effects caused by the force contact of the MM working tool (WT) with the target objects when performing manipulative operations. To calculate these MM effects, a modified algorithm for solving the inverse dynamics problem is used, which does not require the installation of expensive multicomponent force and torque sensors in the MM WT. The results of numerical simulation in Matlab/Simulink with visualization in the CoppeliaSim simulator showed the operability and high efficiency of the synthesized AUV stabilization system when performing manipulation operations.",autonomous underwater vehicle;stabilization system;propulsion and steering complex;contact operations;multi-link manipulators;hover mode,,"Academician M.D. Ageev Institute of Marine Technology Problems Far Eastern Branch of RAS, Vladivostok, Russia; Academician M.D. Ageev Institute of Marine Technology Problems Far Eastern Branch of RAS, Vladivostok, Russia; Academician M.D. Ageev Institute of Marine Technology Problems Far Eastern Branch of RAS, Vladivostok, Russia"

Spaceborne lidar was used to perform a large-scale analysis, and the detailed transport path of pollution was measured by lidar. Pollution transport path forecasting within half an hour and 180 km2 was performed. The forecasting results were in good agreement with the 11 national monitoring stations (NMSs) distributed within the region.

1955,Multi-Target Magnetic Positioning Using SAFCM Clustering and Invariants-Improved Tilt Angle,Q. Li; Z. Li; Z. Shi; H. Fan,2022,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,0,"The positioning of multiple magnetic sources with different depths, distributions, and magnetic moments is extremely difficult. The improved tilt angle (TA) for target area recognition can be well adapted to the self-adaptive fuzzy  $c$ -means (SAFCM) clustering algorithm for the grid measurement of magnetic gradient tensors (MGTs), which provides a feasible solution to solve the complex problem of multi-target inversion. First, we improve the TA with the normalized source strengths and the tensor contraction (TC), which can accurately identify the 2-D area boundary of objects with different buried depths regardless of the magnetization direction. The grid measurements of MGT systems (MGTS) enable this process. Then, with the tensor spacial invariant relations, we calculate the source initial position coordinates corresponding to each node in the recognition area, thereby forming a dense point cloud in the space near the target real position. Finally, we introduce a penalty function into the clustering validity function (CVF) to eliminate the monotonous decreasing trend of the cluster number optimization process; thus, the SAFCM algorithm can accurately and automatically detect the number and position of centroids. The simulation shows that with the Gaussian noise of 0 mean and 5-nT/m variance, the targets number recognition accuracy of 20 magnetic dipoles is 97.6%, and the horizontal position and buried depth estimation accuracy are greater than 91.7% and 85.6%, respectively.

Optical flow thus plays an important role in ghost removal for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. The optical flow estimation is based on the theory of photometric consistency, which assumes that the corresponding pixels between two images have the same intensity. However, the assumption is no longer valid for the differently exposed LDR images since a pixel’s intensity changes significantly inter images. To address the problem, an unsupervised optical flow estimation framework, is presented in this study. Intensity mapping functions (IMFs) are first adopted to alleviate the intensity changes between the LDR images. Then a novel IMF-based unsupervised learning objective is proposed to circumvent the need for ground truth optical flows when training the deep network.

Deng,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,2,"Forests are an important source of ecosystem services, and they are a common link between economic value and environmental protection. Thus, it is of great significance to study forest ecosystem services. In previous studies, scholars have focused on the evaluation results of a single service component, but they did not consider the credibility of the data, which consisted of the cumulative effects of multiple components on forest ecosystem services. The current study examined the forest management plan for Jilin Province and used forest resource inventory data from China. Reliability analysis and cumulative impact assessment were used to overcome the problem of cumulative changes and interactions between services in order to make the evaluation results more objective and reasonable. The results showed that the resulting two values from the evaluation of forest ecosystem services had no obvious cumulative effect, and the evaluation value for overall reliability was 0.774, which confirms that the results have a certain credibility. The results of this study considered the cumulative effect of forest ecosystem services on the value evaluation. The total value of the service was equal to the sum of each service value, which might be primarily related to the data format and sample size used in this study. The innovation of this research lies in the consideration of data reliability and the cumulative influence of the services on the value evaluation process, which makes up for the shortcomings of previous service value evaluation methods. However, the limitation of this study is that multiple reference groups and control groups were not set up to verify that the inconsistency in the evaluation results was indeed due to the data format and sample size. Future research will focus on comparative studies of data types and sample sizes.

In order to enable this transition, an end-to-end comprehensive 5G architecture is needed, with capabilities to support the use cases of the different vertical industries. A key feature of this architecture is the implementation of network slicing over a single infrastructure to provision highly heterogeneous vertical services, as well as a network slicing management system capable of handling simultaneous slices.

Gao,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,12,"The study of the construction of a micro-scale rupture parameter from the perspective of rock stress and strain is a frontier in geoscience. The strain energy density (U) can quantitatively characterize the probability of internal micro-scale ruptures in different types of rock. Based on this, in this paper, a systematic forecasting method for tight sandstone sweet spots in a low-amplitude tectonic zone based on U -value calculations was proposed. The specific steps are as follows. First, a geological model of the target layer was created, and a new rock mechanics parameter assignment method based on sedimentary facies control principle was proposed. Then, the palaeo-tectonic stress field of the target layer in the Yanshanian period was recovered through the boundary loading. Finally, the strain energy density distribution of the target layer was obtained based on energy conservation principle. The simulation results of the paleo-tectonic stress field show that, the distribution of horizontal stress is mainly affected by lithology and local structure, and the vertical stress is mainly affected by the burial depth. Stress diffusion occurs in some areas, which are mainly affected by lithologic mutations or complex structures. The U values of the target layers have a band-like distribution and are mainly distributed between 0.12 and 0.30 J·m-3. The relationship between strain energy density and productivity of tight sandstone reservoirs was analyzed, and the criteria for distinguishing sweet spot areas based on U values were proposed.

However, these three issues have not been simultaneously considered by the existing methods. This article presents a comprehensive radiometric normalization method for multitemporal HRSI using a radiometric block adjustment without master images. Pseudoinvariant features (PIFs) extracted from image pairs using the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection are used as the corresponding pixel observations and organized to form radiometric tie points according to the corresponding horizontal space coordinates. Radiometric error equations are subsequently constructed, and the linear radiometric transformation parameters are solved by a global adjustment. The time-invariant PIFs generally represent the true corresponding features and naturally avoid the cloud, water, and land changes, which can eliminate the effects of outliers. Furthermore, the pixel values of tie points calculated from the weighted average of the corresponding pixel observations are used as virtual radiometric control points to eliminate the dependency on master images. Moreover, a global optimum can be achieved by the global adjustment, effectively overcoming the error accumulation, which is severe in large datasets.

Zhou,2021,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,9,"The three-dimensional deformation monitoring of landslides is very complex due to the uncertainty of movement direction and the difficulty in searching the corresponding points before and after deformation. In this study, a landslide deformation monitoring method based on the integration of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is presented. This method can quickly obtain high-precision and large-scale terrain information in the absence of sufficient ground control points (GCPs) and can accurately describe the real movement of landslides. The real-time kinematic (RTK) and post-processed kinematic (PPK) are applied to localize the initial positions of TLS and UAV, respectively. The iterative closest point algorithm is applied to register the TLS and UAV point cloud data. Then, the RTK-based GCPs and TLS-based GCPs are obtained to improve the accuracy of UAV data. After that, 3D deformation analyses based on shortest distance method and horizontal deformation based on the difference of orthophotos are applied through point clouds and orthophotos. The proposed method is demonstrated by monitoring a reactivated ancient landslide (Aniangzhai) in Danba County, Southwest China. The real deformation of the landslide has been validated with the registered TLS data. The results indicate that the downcutting of the riverbed and erosion to the slope toe caused by the dam break flood are the main reasons for the reactivation.",Ancient landslide;data fusion;deformation analysis;monitoring method;reactivation mechanism;remote sensing,,"State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"

Performance benchmarking of the stacked FET arrays at the iso-footprint is accomplished to explore the roles of sheet configurations further with stack number and sheet spacing changed. It is found that the benefit of the larger effective channel width provided by the wider NSH is always compromised by degraded gate control, especially in the Ge channel.

However, [100] channel vertically confined along [011] shows greater potential for the applications of wider Si and Ge NSHs in the stacked FET array.

In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called POCA, enabling the first power-on chip authentication during wafer sort to securely provision design assets inside the chip. Using POCA, the design house can authenticate the chips on the untrusted manufacturing/test floor and generate a shared secret key with the chip. This key is then utilized to encrypt the secret assets and securely provision them inside the chip after decryption. To the best of our knowledge, POCA is the first protocol that performs authentication at an untrusted foundry and ensures secure communication with the chip during the test.

Renumol,2022,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,2,"According to the oscillation theory of handwriting, letters are formed by the coupled modulation of horizontal and vertical oscillations of the hands. This modulation-oscillation scheme requires human motor control. Hence, one of the reasons for poor handwriting is a lack of fine motor skills. The main objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate a hand therapeutic application (HanDex) for children with writing difficulties to enhance their hand dexterity. This paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of the HanDex app. It has mainly six activities for improving tripod grip, hand-eye coordination, spatial organization, letter formation, and fine motor skills. The main principle underlying the design of these activities is the oscillation theory of handwriting. A set of user interface (UI) guidelines have been followed in the UI design for simplicity, user motivation, easy navigation, etc. User evaluation of the prototype was conducted by ten participants in five iterations, and the final product was built by considering their feedback. Subsequently, we conducted case studies on two primary school children with poor handwriting skills to test the effectiveness of the application. This study used a single-subject pretest-posttest design to observe and measure the efficacy of the HanDex application. The posttest results showed a positive impact on letter formation, size of letters, spacing of letters and words, placement, speed, and legibility in these children. Hence, the HanDex app is promising and warrants further investigation in more children with different levels of handwriting difficulty.",Digital tools;evolutionary prototyping;fine motor skill;HCI principles;handwriting difficulty;hand dexterity;Tablet PC;touch-based interfaces,,"School of Engineering, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, Kerala, India; School of Engineering, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, Kerala, India"

In the distributed database system, we implement sharding for the distribution of vertical and horizontal fragmentation. In today's business environment there is a growing need for distributed databases and client/server applications as the demand for reliable, scalable and accessible information continues to grow. Distributed database systems provide improvements in communication and data processing due to the distribution of its data across different network sites. Not only is data access faster, but a point of failure is also less likely, and it gives users local control over the data. Some concerns are being addressed when designing and using these strategies. A distributed database is a collection of databases that can be stored on various computer network sites. This article gives an overview of the advantages and disadvantages as well as distributed database systems. This article also covers various aspects such as duplication, fragmentation and various issues that can be encountered in a distributed database system. Fragmenting data involves optimization because each query involves adding more than one piece of data to different sites. It produces a high time response. The scientific approach to solving this problem has been tested because it is known as the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem. Extracting data is another special issue that involves finding the maximum distribution of fragments on sites. This non-multiple polynomial has already proven to be a complete problem.

Al-Hemiary,2021,"2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",IEEE Conferences,1,"In today’s modern world, distributed ledgers have become dominant in several sophisticated applications to remove the centralized controlling entity (e.g., Cloud Computing). The currents are problematic to meet the dramatic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), for instance, Blockchain and Tangle. The former is very secure but has a very slow confirmation time, and low throughput. The latter has more throughput; however, sometimes records are getting left behind. On the other hand, the existing consensus algorithms that determine who can add new records into a ledger, are particularly energy-intensive, unfair, or deemed infeasible for resource-constrained Things. In this paper, a novel consensus algorithm based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)-to-Blockchain is proposed in horizontal architecture to mitigate the scalability issues, in which every limited number of nodes are grouped. It consists of five permissioned nodes of different responsibilities: (i) Things send data from sensors with signature to Edge. Every interval, (ii) each Edge node chooses a random number, and auto-decrement it. The first node reaches zero, becomes the winner that can add the verified data temporally to the DAG ledger (Cobweb) depends on uniform distribution. The rest of the nodes who are waiting for the leader, rate it based on its work (rate scores from 1-to-5) after accepting Cobweb from it. (iii) Fog node is chosen randomly from Edge to send Cobweb periodically with authentication to reduce the required storage. (iv) Cloud nodes receive and add it permanently to the Blockchain ledger with global accessibility. (v) Queen node is located between Fog and Cloud, which monitors the network.

The orientation is completed by horizontal plane registration and elevation registration parts. The proposed method is composed of five steps: 1) using the proposed method to extract the corner points from the building outline of DLG; 2) using the proposed method based on RANSAC algorithm to extract the corner points and the facade point clouds of the TLS data; 3) coarse alignment of the two extracted sets of corner points using four-point congruent set algorithm; 4) fine registration by 2D-ICP algorithm; and 5) completing elevation registration using elevation control points.

The principles are common in social sciences and control theory, respectively. This proposal leads to organizing the network as a hierarchy of interacting rational agents with vertical and horizontal weak coupling. The central agent provides a performance goal and constraints to the lower level agents that operate almost autonomously in this multi-agent system. The system has various favorable properties, including stability, reliability, and efficiency. Present self-organizing networks are usually distributed without any centralized controller. The lack of a common externally given goal may lead to low performance, staggering behavior, or even chaotic situations. In communications, each transmitter can be interpreted as a rational lower level agent. A principle resembling subsidiarity, the locality principle, is used, for example, in cellular automata, systolic arrays, and edge computing. Subsidiarity is also a solution for the tragedy of the commons where common resources are overused because the costs are divided equally among the users, often with some significant delay.

This study specifically focuses on virtual turning and evaluates user experience in the task of searching and collecting objects appeared around the player in the first-person view. Typical conventional control schemes for turning includes the smooth and snap turns. The smooth turn is continuous turning performed by moving a scene in the horizontal direction. In this case, reflexive eye movement occurs even in the absence of physical motion, which often causes eye strain and nausea. The snap turn achieves a prompt direction change by omitting intervening turning, which often damages the sense of reality. To address these negative effects, we propose the novel turning method inspired by the particular human behavior, which achieves to reorient the gazed view towards the center. Prompt reorientation during rapid head motion and blinking performed unnoticeable scene switching that achieved the seamless user experience, especially for the wide-angle turning. Whereas, continuous narrow-angle turning by horizontally rotating the virtual world corresponding to the face orientation achieved enhanced the sense of reality. The proposal comprises a hybrid of these two turning schemes.

This enables a means of new applications including building control and industrial automation and integration. The paper presents a comprehensive 3D indoor industrial channel characterization to represent the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model CM 7. Using a ray-based recipe, this is achieved by considering a general wave with horizontal and vertical polarizations. The field evaluation is performed ray-by-ray and is thus affected by the transfer functions of both the transmitting and receiving antennas. In addition, a deterministic procedure to evaluate the magnitude and phase of the voltage captured by each receiving antenna in a 3D wideband massive MIMO channel is proposed. The channel conditioning is evaluated via the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of both the channel matrix singular value spread (SVS) and the correlation coefficient among users' channels, and the sum-rate capacity. The assessment is carried out by using a uniform rectangular array (URA) and a uniform linear array (ULA) at the base station. It is found that URAs provide enhanced channel conditioning and therefore higher capability for spatial separation of users' channels is guaranteed with respect to analogous ULAs. Moreover, due to the improved spatial diversity of the URAs, constructed by combining two orthogonal ULAs, the achieved sum-rate for a URA setup is higher than that for the corresponding ULA.

Brodjonegoro,2020,2020 6th Information Technology International Seminar (ITIS),IEEE Conferences,1,"In this paper, compensation of an inertial navigation system (INS) errors based on position references from a long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system is presented. This problem arises form the inherent tendency of an INS to accumulate errors over the time. To mitigate this drawback, the INS needs to be corrected in certain period using an accurate reference. In terrestrial and aerial applications, these references are mostly provided by the global positioning systems (GPS). In the absence of GPS in the water, its aforementioned role can be taken by due to their resemblance in terms of configurations and working principles. However, since propagation speed of an underwater acoustic wave is not necessarily constant, its trajectory-the raytrace-henceforth may not be linear. When this is the case, the well-developed methods and technique in the GPS community cannot be directly borrowed and implemented to a LBL. The main contribution of this paper is to deal with deal with the above INS/LBL navigation while taking the characteristic of underwater acoustic wave into account. Specifically, it is considered interactions between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a LBL in a region where its sound-speed-profile (SSP) can be approximated as a quadratic function of depth. When a time-of-flight (ToF) measurement occur between an acoustic transponder and the AUV, the horizontal pseudorange between these two points is then estimated by calculating its Snell parameter. Once pseudoranges from all transponders are available, the so-called pseudorange-differences method can be used to compute the subject horizontal position. Subsequently, the INS as primer navigation aid can use this reference to compensate the errors. By simulation, we demonstrate that the LBL can provide the position reference with averaged errors less than 2 m.",long baseline;INS;sensor fusion;state estimation;underwater acoustics,,"Engineering Physics Research Group, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia; Engineering Physics Research Group, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia; Engineering Physics Research Group, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia; Offshore Engineering Research Group, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"

The main objective is to find the shortest trajectory between the initial and target locations while considering the hexapod’s physical constraints, such as the maximum step length, as well as collision avoidance with surrounding obstacles. Since rectangular hexapod robots perform better in forward and side motion compared to angular motion, it is preferable to move either horizontally or vertically. Therefore, finding the desired direction of motion (horizontal or vertical) is also considered during the trajectory planning procedure. First, a kinematic model of the hexapod is presented. Then, the planned trajectory is divided into a number of segments. Subsequently, GA is applied to find the optimum design variables that yield the shortest and collision-free trajectory. These variables include the number of steps, the length of each step, and the corresponding direction of motion (horizontal or vertical) during each segment. Finally, different simulation scenarios are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, convergence, and stability of the proposed algorithm.",Hexapod robots;legged machines;trajectory generation;genetic algorithm (GA),,"Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Egyptian Academy for Engineering and Advanced Technology, Cairo, Egypt"

There are many issues on the automation of bin picking of small metal parts. In such objects, even if a grasping target can be identified, it is a challenging task to pick it up stable. We propose a novel end-effector using wire thrusting mechanism which enables to grasp a part with holes by squeezing from inside of a hole. Then we built the proposed mechanism and performed experiments using actual 21 cylindrical metal parts. We confirmed that the gripping of the metal parts placed on a horizontal plane performed as designed. In addition, we also confirmed that the same degree of gripping was possible when the inclination was unti118 degrees from the horizontal state.

While many ET cases are benign, some require pharmacological and surgical management, and there is a need for tools to assist clinicians in making informed decisions. This work aimed to develop a computerized technique to detect the presence and severity of ET. A set of 6 writing and sketching tasks were performed by 39 subjects on a digital tablet. The position and pressure of contact during the sketching were recorded and analyzed to obtain the dynamics of drawing. ET patients were scored on the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale by blinded movement disorder neurologists, and then separated into two groups: moderate and severe ET. Drawing tasks were more effective than writing tasks in distinguishing the groups, with drawing horizontal and vertical lines being the most sensitive. A new set of composite index feature was found to be most suitable in separating the three groups, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.72. The technique shows significant differences between controls, patients with moderate tremor and those with severe tremor, with an accuracy of 87.2%.

For cells distributed on different horizontal planes in a thick liquid layer, it is challenging to image all of them clearly.

Liang,2020,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,48,"Network slicing (NS) has been widely identified as a key architectural technology for 5G-and-beyond systems by supporting divergent requirements in a sustainable way. In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party. Numerical results show that the proposed HDRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and communication efficiency in comparison with some state-of-the-art solutions.",RAN slicing;device association;federated learning;deep reinforcement learning,,"National Key Lab on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; National Key Lab on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; National Key Lab on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; National Key Lab on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; National Key Lab on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"

Lu,2022,2022 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN),IEEE Conferences,0,"Irradiated Cross-linked Polyethylene Foam (IXPE) has been one of the most commonly used materials in industry. During the production process of IXPE sheets, their edges need keep aligned strictly, otherwise, they could quickly get out of the border of the rolling plate and cause the huge economic loss. In this paper, we propose a camera-enabled approach, called Edge-Eye, to rectify the edge deviation automatically for IXPE production with millimeter-level accuracy. We deploy a commercial camera with mobile edge node in front of the IXPE sheet to continuously detect and rectify the edge deviation. Particularly, to handle the complex production en-vironment when extracting the edge of IXPE sheet, we deploy a pair of reference bars with high-contrast colors to efficiently differ-entiate the sheet edge from the background. Then, we propose a Bi-direction Edge Tracking method to perform the edge detection from both vertical and horizontal aspects. To realize the rectification using mobile edge nodes with limited computing resources, we reduce the cost of computation by extracting the Minimized Region of Interest, i.e., the edge area overlapped with the higher contrast reference bar on both sides. We further design a negative feedback control system with multi-stage feedback regulation mechanism, keeping the edge deviation within millimeter-level. We implemented Edge-Eye on the ARM64 platform and performed evaluation in the practical IXPE production process. The experimental results show that Edge-Eye achieves the average accuracy of 5mm for the edge deviation rectification, with the average latency of 200ms for edge deviation detection. During the process of 20-month real deployment for 36 production lines, 66 manpower per day (90% of the overall manpower) has been saved, and the utilization rate of IXPE material increases from 87% to 94%.",IXPE Production;Computer Vision;Edge Deviation Rectification;Industial Internet of Things,,"State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; School of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"

In this array, there are four channels and each channel consists of three CSRRs, forming a  $4\times 3$  sensing array that is developed in the ground plane of a microstrip line using a low-cost FR4 substrate. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) generates three discrete frequencies: 1.88 GHz, 2.60 GHz, and 3.61 GHz to each channel, which is sequentially selected using a single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switch. The transmitted RF signals are converted into the DC voltage levels and are interpreted by a microcontroller.

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled multicasting system, where a UAV with a directional antenna of adjustable beamwidth is employed to disseminate a common file to a group of ground users. By minimizing the mission completion time, we investigate how beamwidth control would affect the UAV's three-dimensional (3D) location/trajectory. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is deployed at a static location. In this case, we jointly optimize the 3D UAV location and antenna beamwidth under the practical constraints on the UAV's altitude and beamwidth, while ensuring that all users are covered by the main lobe of the UAV antenna. Although this problem is nonconvex, its global optimality can be obtained by using a two-step algorithm, where semi-closed solutions of the 3D location and beamwidth are derived. Next, in the mobile UAV scenario, a joint 3D UAV trajectory and beamwidth design is proposed, additionally constrained by the horizontal and vertical speed. To tackle this nonconvex problem, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation techniques, which updates the 3D trajectory and beamwidth simultaneously in each iteration.

This sytem carries messages containing aircraft's position from a collection of radars of an Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) through its network. Then Radar traffic is one of the most important sources of information for this system. The format of the radar messages is defined by a specific application-layer protocol entitled ASTERIX. The evolution of the security policy and technologies used makes existing radar systems, once considered safe, now potentially open to attack. Both safety and security of ATM system could be impacted by any kind of attack into the network traffic, who could maliciously modified information about aicrafts, in particular thanks to Spoofing Attack. To counter this risk, there is need to detect intrusion and then to have anomaly detection modules for this safety-critical network traffic, that can be deployed in a security appliance. In order to design this module, we did a statistical analysis to have an overview of the traffic to better know what we need to protect. Specifically, we studied radar network traffic in order to extract high level statistic characteristics of normal radar traffic. This allowed us to identify a trend in the evolution of this traffic. We were then able to inject a spoofing attack (when a malicious party impersonates another device or network user for the purpose of altering the data) into this traffic to modify the nominal traffic. Thereafter, we were able to detect this attack using our method, which consists of the use of a machine learning detection method, using a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) mechanism. This is the subject of our paper, an overview of radar traffic and a method to detect spoofing attack in this traffic.

However, the position of the UAV may fluctuate randomly in the horizontal and vertical directions due to wind, system stability error, or attitude control system fault, which may affect the mmWave channel blockage characteristic and system quality of service (QoS) performance. In this letter, we study the impact of UAV fluctuations in the vertical direction on the blockage and QoS of air-to-ground mmWave UAV communications for the first time. By deriving the closed-form expressions of blockage probability, we find that although the blockage probability is proportional to the variance of the vertical fluctuation, the vertical fluctuation has little effect on the blockage probability due to the small weight of the variance. In contrast, vertical fluctuations significantly impact the reliable service probability. The stronger the vertical fluctuation is, the smaller the reliable service probability and the worse the QoS.

The dynamic equation of transmission line under strong wind load is derived by using dynamic theory. Considering the dynamic action of wind load as simple harmonic load, the response of transmission line under dynamic wind load is studied. The results show that there are complex nonlinear phenomena, such as subharmonic resonance and super harmonic resonance, in addition to the main resonance.

Basically, it consists of a modified flying wing with a single combustion powertrain set and a multirotor with 2 powertrain sets with electric motors. With the electric propellers fixed at the leading wing edge, the tailsitter has two standard surfaces for elevation control and two vertical stabilizers that are used to give the necessary direction on vertical takeoff and landing. We have designed, built, and tested a prototype based on this new double-hybrid concept, which spends less energy on vertical taking off and landing and also on horizontal flight, thus maximizing flight endurance and travelled distance. We performed several experimental tests starting with the aircraft on the ground in vertical positioning. These tests include executing vertical takeoffs and landing, transitions from vertical to horizontal flight modes and transitions back (from horizontal to vertical), and hovering, which were carried out successfully.

However, the blended interference severely obscures the coherent signal, challenging the conventional seismic data processing methods. Recently, convolution neural network (CNN) has been successfully implemented to address the blended interference. Different from CNN, the self-attention mechanism-based transformer neural network is good at capturing the global features. In this letter, we propose a deblending transformer (DT) based on the transformer module to separate the simultaneous source data. The DT architecture mainly includes linear embedding operation, patch partition-based transformer block, and output projection layer. The patch partition algorithm is embedded into the multihead self-attention (MHSA) module, which extracts the vertical, horizontal, and local information. In addition, with the help of linear embedding operation and output projection algorithm, the DT can easily extract the global features from the input.

By allocating the SRR arrays in close proximity to each horn antenna, the radiation power in the specified horizontal directions pointing to each other could be significantly reduced without disturbing their radiation characteristics in the broadside thus leading to the conspicuous port isolation enhancement. It is validated that more than 25 dB mutual coupling level reduction is achieved over the frequency range of 8–11.5 GHz (∼35.9% fractional bandwidth) when the SRR arrays are integrated.

However, the approximate nature of the results obtained during the numerical calculation makes it difficult to develop general theoretical and practical conclusions. In this regard, the issues of developing accurate analytical methods for calculating electromagnetic parameters and operating modes of electromechanical systems remain relevant. The article presents a mathematical model of the magnetic field of a magnetoelectric valve motor using the Fourier– Euler variable separation method. The field created by the rotor magnets and the current of the stator winding was assumed to be plane-parallel. The active region of the engine was divided into a set of geometrically homogeneous horizontal bands, at the boundaries of which the conditions of conjugation of their magnetic fields are fulfilled: scalar magnetic potentials and normal components of magnetic induction do not undergo a jump (rupture). In addition to permanent magnets and stator winding currents, magnetizations of ferromagnetic sections of its magnetic circuit were considered as sources of the magnetic field. The article presents the design scheme of the engine and the corresponding Fourier-Euler equations for scalar potentials and magnetic inductions. Based on them, a system of linear parametric equations with respect to unknown Fourier constants is obtained.

Supernumerary Robotic Limb (SuperLimb), as a promising wearable robotic solution, can provide assistance in terms of broader workspace, wider manipulation functionalities and safer working conditions. However, the safety concerns of human-centered SuperLimb interaction mechanisms are rarely studied to date, particularly regarding human standing balance. This study proposes a balance controller by which one individual operator can accomplish overhead tasks with the assistance of SuperLimb via tunable interaction force and supporting force regulation. The SuperLimb-human interaction is modeled and a dynamics control method based on QR decomposition (also known as QR factorization, in which a matrix is factorized into an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix) is adopted to decouple joint torques of the SuperLimb and the interaction forces. Therefore, the supporting forces can be regulated independently to guarantee the operator-SuperLimb interaction forces in a safe region. Force plate is used for measuring the CoP position as an evaluation method of the standing balance. The critical horizontal push force is learned through experiment to guide the balance controller. This method is implemented on a SuperLimb prototype worn on the operator's back, to provide necessary supporting forces on overhead object while allowing the operator to move freely underneath.",Balance;overhead tasks;supernumerary robotic limb;wearable robots,,"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Biomimetic Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Biomimetic Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Beijing Institute of General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), Beijing, China; George W.

Once the human body moves, the location is not accurate, and the real-time detection and recognition of acupoints cannot be performed. Considering the small size and the complex information of acupoints, this paper uses QR code for acupoints identification, which is convenient and laconic. The QR code is printed on A4 paper at 1x1 cm scale, and captured though camera.

Such concept of event driven processing has been used to reduce system energy for regular cameras as well [2]. However, an object typically occupies a fraction of the full image frame (Fig. 1) leading to a significant spatial redundancy in the image. Hence, an energy-efficient hardware is required to detect the region of interests (RoIs) in the valid frames to trigger an object recognition engine only for the RoIs. For a binary image, the region proposal can be performed by the connected component labeling (CCL) algorithm [2]. However, CCL scans the image in a raster fashion to calculate the ROIs leading to longer execution time and higher energy dissipation due to enormous data transfer.

As a technique to reduce on-chip current demand, voltage stacking has become a topic of growing interest within the industrial and academic communities. The challenges of on-chip voltage stacking are however significant. The limitations of relying on on-chip decoupling capacitors when load imbalances occur within a high current system are reviewed. To manage these load imbalances, a ladder topology switched capacitor converter is proposed to regulate the voltages between layers within a voltage stacked system. A 20X improvement in voltage drop is demonstrated on a case study. The current path within a voltage stacked system is quite different from a standard system. A horizontal current path is formed due to the serial connection between layers, producing large parasitic impedances within the power network.

The presence of free gas at the pump-intake is a big challenge to achieve the maximum potential from oil wells. To improve ESP performance, it is necessary to understand the two-phase flow behavior at the ESP intake. The objective of this work is to study the two-phase air-water flow behavior at the intake of an ESP for different operating conditions. In this study, a set of experiments were conducted using a two-phase prototype test flow loop. The total fluid mixture flow rate was 1250 barrels/day (bpd), inlet pressure was approximately 1.5 barg $(\sim 22$ psig) and inclination angles to the horizontal were 45° and 90°. The intake gas volume fraction (GVF) was varied from 10% to 70%. For this preliminary study, the ESP rotational speed was kept at zero RPM. Images of the air-water flow conditions in the plexiglass test section upstream of the ESP were captured using a high-speed camera. At lower intake GVFs (10 & 30%), dispersed bubbly and occasional slug flow patterns were observed. At higher intake GVFs (50 & 70%), larger slugs and liquid flow reversal (liquid bubbles falling back) were observed. It was also observed that the density of bubbles increased with increasing intake GVF.

To keep the inter-electrode gap small for efficient electrostatic force actuation, the pistons are located close to the underside of the mirror and move independently as the mirror deforms. The mirror membrane is 8 mm in diameter, 2µm thick and made of single crystal silicon. With a horizontal orientation the relatively large weight of the pistons, fabricated into thick silicon substrate, deform the mirror. However, by placing the device vertically, a bidirectional motion and upward displacement of 0.2 µm with 30 V actuation was confirmed.

In this study, the designed rotor is rotated by the rotating magnetic field of the secondary of the induction motor (IM). The magnetic bearing rotor has the function of the secondary side of the IM. In order to verify whether this instability affects the levitation characteristics by the pinning force, the horizontal angle of the rotor during the rotation is measured. At that time, the rotational characteristics are measured. Vibration suddenly occurred at a low rotational speed after the power supply started. After that, the rotor rotated stably. The inclination of the rotor is suppressed by 37.4% when the levitation gap g decreases. The pinning force increases as the levitation gap decreases. Therefore, the vibration suppressing effect of the rotor is obtained and the average angle is decreased. From the rotational experiments, it was confirmed the rotor with secondary of the IM function does not affect the levitation characteristics by the pinning force.",Flywheel;high temperature superconductor;induction motor;magnetic bearing;permanent magnets,,"Kansai University, Osaka, Japan; Kansai University, Osaka, Japan; Kansai University, Osaka, Japan"

Kafadar,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,11,"Recently, the passive seismic techniques based on the microtremor measurements have emerged as an alternative to conventional seismic and geotechnical methods used in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, especially in the local site effect investigations. These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module.

The robot hand grabs the object first and then releases it. In order to reduce the cost, the general robot hand is made into two parts with relative motion in order to realize the function of grasping and releasing. There are also many structures that mimic human hands and are designed to have more fingers and several joints, but that leads to higher system complexity. In order to solve the problems of adaptability and complexity, we design an adaptive robot hand with spiral blade expansion slide tube array.

The traditional CSB-I hand arc sliding bar cannot exceed the central plane and has a small sliding range, which is disadvantageous to grasp non-centered objects. In the design of CSB-II hand, the main drive shaft is changed from vertical direction to horizontal direction in CSB-I hand, which not only makes the tendon rope winding more reasonable, but also frees up sliding space of the sliding rod and enlarges the sliding range of the arc sliding rod by more than 30%.

Huang,2020,2020 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education (ICISCAE),IEEE Conferences,1,"Ensuring the accurate positioning of the vehicle at any time is the key to navigation and path planning in unmanned driving vehicle. Due to the changes and signal attenuation of vehicle-mounted GPS signals when they pass through electric clouds, and the reflection of GPS signals when they encounter glass curtain wall, and under underground garages, tunnels and overpasses, for example, GPS satellite signals cannot be received by vehicle-mounted GPS locator due to the obstruction of buildings. The above-mentioned situations will cause the vehicle GPS positioning signal to be unstable or even missing. And the current positioning method based on lidar has become the mainstream positioning method for unmanned vehicles. However, under bad weather conditions, the detection capability of infrared waves will be greatly attenuated, and the stability of lidar positioning will also be affected. Therefore, this paper introduces an unmanned driving vehicle positioning method based on GPS/lidar/derivative data fusion when the environment map is known. That is, when the GPS signal is good and the lidar is in good weather conditions, the vehicle can be accurately positioned by GPS/lidar/derivation fusion. While the GPS positioning signal or lidar positioning is unstable and in the event of a short absence, it is still can achieve accurate positioning of intelligent vehicles through a derivation-based approach. The experimental data and MATLAB software simulation results show that the horizontal error of vehicle positioning is within the range of 14.3cm and the longitudinal error is within the range of 8.8cm, within 5 seconds after the lidar and GPS signals are lost simultaneously.",GPS;Lidar positioning;Derivation;Data fusion;Missing positioning signals;MATLAB,,"Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"

It describes the operation of a single-axis solar tracker at coordinates of 23.6693⁰ Latitude and 86.1511⁰ Longitude. Developing a single-axis solar tracker has as its main goal to detect the sun’s position throughout the day. The zenith angle, Berger-Duffie model and the most basic clear sky global horizontal irradiance (GHI) i.e., the highest solar radiation on Earth’s surface in a particular moment and location in the absence of clouds, were used to determine the solar irradiance over the course of a day. The total energy produced during the day was also measured. This technology’s basic tenet is to maximize solar radiation from dawn until dusk to account for the sun’s shifting locations during the winter. The maximum power received from the panels is determined using the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique. The energy gain and efficiency of the suggested tracking unit, as shown in the findings, are provided in the form of graphs and tables which indicates that the Single Axis Solar Tracker performs noticeably admirable than the Static Solar System.

Rotor vibrations induce noise, decrease the lifespan of bearings, produce additional load to structures, and can directly affect the end product as in a paper production. Therefore, vibration must be avoided and reduced to its minimum.Accelerometers are commonly used to measure the frequencies and the amplitudes of the vibrations. Anyway, accelerometers are not capable of detecting forces like periodic radial bearing forces created by rotor vibrations. Thus, these forces are typically unknown or estimated by simulations. Lack of exact information leads to a situation, in which under-and over-dimensioning can occur, hindering effective material use and lifespan optimization.To tackle this problem a measurement device was designed and built to measure radial bearing forces of large-scale rotors, which produce considerable dynamic forces and have lower natural frequency compared to smaller rotors.

2063,Mitigating the ill-posedness of first-arrival traveltime tomography using slopes: application to the eastern Nankai Trough (Japan) OBS data set,S. Sambolian; A. Gorszczyk; S. Operto; A. Ribodetti; B. Tavakoli F.,2021,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"First-arrival traveltime tomography is one of the most used velocity model building techniques especially in sparse wide-angle acquisitions for deep crustal seismic imaging cases. Relying on the inversion of a picked attribute, the absolute traveltimes, the approach is ill-posed in terms of non-uniqueness of the solution. The latter is remedied by proper regularization or the introduction of prior information. Indeed, since traveltime kernels are vulnerable to the velocity–depth ambiguity, the inversion is stabilized by the introduction of complementary data like reflections and explicit reflectors in the velocity models. Here, we propose to supplement first-arrival traveltimes by their slopes, in other words the horizontal component of the slowness vectors at the sources and/or receivers. Slopes are a crucial attribute in state of the art scattering-based or reflection-based tomographic methods like slope tomography or wavefront tomography where the differential information is needed in order to locate the scattering events position or to parametrize the wavefront. The optional but valuable injection of slopes as an objective measure in first-arrival traveltime tomography stabilizes the problem by constraining the emergence angle or in turn implicitly the turning point depth of the rays. We explain why slopes have a tremendous added value in such a tomographic problem and highlight its remedial effect in cases where the medium is unevenly illuminated. We also show that the contribution of slopes become even more significant when the acquisition is sparse as it is generally the case with ocean-bottom seismometer surveys. The inferred models from such an extended time-attributes tomography will be used as initial guesses in a full-waveform inversion workflow context. The proposed strategy is benchmarked in 2-D media against a dip section of the SEG/EAGE overthrust model and then followed by a revisit of ocean bottom seismometers data from the eastern-Nankai subduction margin as a real deep crustal case study.",Inverse theory;Waveform inversion;Controlled source seismology;Crustal Imaging;Seismic tomography,,"Université Côte d’Azur, Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, CNRS, IRD, Géoazur, 06560 Valbonne, France; sambolian@geoazur.unice.fr; Institute for Geophysics, Polish academy of Science, 01-452 Warsaw, Poland; Université Grenoble Alpes, ISTerre, 38610 Gières, France; Université Côte d’Azur, Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, CNRS, IRD, Géoazur, 06560 Valbonne, France; Université Côte d’Azur, Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, CNRS, IRD, Géoazur, 06560 Valbonne, France; Université Côte d’Azur, Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, CNRS, IRD, Géoazur, 06560 Valbonne, France"
2064,Elastic Deployment of Software Containers in Geo-Distributed Computing Environments,F. Rossi; V. Cardellini; F. L. Presti,2019,2019 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),IEEE Conferences,9,"Software containers are ever more adopted to manage and execute distributed applications. Indeed, they enable to quickly scale the amount of computing resources by means of horizontal and vertical elasticity. Most of the existing works consider the deployment of containers in centralized data centers. However, to exploit the diffused presence of edge/fog computing resources, we need new solutions that deploy containers while also considering their placement on decentralized resources. In this paper, we present a two-step approach that manages the run-time adaptation of container-based applications deployed over geo-distributed virtual machines. In the first step, our approach exploits Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions to control the horizontal and vertical elasticity of the containers. In the second step, it addresses the container placement by solving a suitable integer linear programming problem or using a network-aware heuristic. A wide set of simulation results shows the benefits and flexibility of the proposed approach, which can satisfy stringent application requirements expressed in terms of response time percentiles.",Containers;Elasticity;Placement;Self-adaptation;Geographically distributed resources,,"DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy; DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy; DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy"
2065,A Three-Layered Adjustable Frequency-Selective Surface for Wireless Applications,G. Itami; Y. Toriumi; J. Kato,2019,IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,IEEE Journals,7,"A three-layered adjustable frequency-selective surface (FSS) is proposed and investigated. The FSS consists of a main resonator in the middle layer and two subresonators in the upper and lower layers of a sandwich structure. The resonant frequency can be varied by shifting the upper and lower layers symmetrically. This has the advantages that the same frequency characteristics can be obtained in both vertical and horizontal polarizations and that its fabrication is easy, eliminating the need for electronic elements such as varactor diodes to control capacitance, although the FSS is not suitable for situations that require real-time tuning. This article confirms that the resonant frequency can be varied from f0 to 1.7 f0 in a microwave band which covers multiple wireless bands, with good angular stability in both vertical and horizontal polarizations, by shifting the upper and lower layer overlaps by up to 1.8 mm. Note that f0 is the lowest resonant frequency, and the size of a unit cell is varied from 0.066λ to 0.125λ. Also, the adjustment capability and the angular stability of an FSS fabricated by using a silver inkjet printer are experimentally demonstrated, by simply stacking and shifting the three films.",Equivalent circuit model;frequency-selective surface (FSS);miniaturization,,"Network Technology Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Musashino, Japan; Network Technology Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Musashino, Japan; Network Technology Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Musashino, Japan"
2066,Exploiting Spectral and Cepstral Handwriting Features on Diagnosing Parkinson’s Disease,J. A. Nolazco-Flores; M. Faundez-Zanuy; V. M. De La Cueva; J. Mekyska,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,7,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease associated with several motor symptoms, including alterations in handwriting, also known as PD dysgraphia. Several computerized decision support systems for PD dysgraphia have been proposed, however, the associated challenges require new approaches for more accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this work adds spectral and cepstral handwriting features to the already-used temporal, kinematic and statistics handwriting features. First, we calculate temporal and kinematic features using displacement; statistic features  $\left ({SF }\right)$  using displacement, and horizontal and vertical displacement; spectral  $\left ({SDF }\right)$  and cepstral  $\left ({CDF }\right)$  using displacement, horizontal and vertical displacement and pressure. Since the employed dataset (PaHaW) contains only 37 PD patients and 38 healthy control subjects (HC), then as the second step, we augment the percentage of the smaller training set to equal the larger. Next, we augment both classes to increase the training patient’s data and added random Gaussian noise in all augmentations. Third, the most relevant features were selected using the modified fast correlation-based filtering method (mFCBF). Finally, autoML is employed to train and test more than ten plain and ensembled classifiers. Experimental results show that adding spectral and cepstral features to temporal, kinematics and statistics features highly improved classification accuracy to 98.57%.

2067,Darks and Stripes: Effects of Clothing on Weight Perception,K. Martynov; K. Garimella; R. West,2020,Journal of Social Computing,TUP Journals,2,"In many societies, appearing slim (corresponding to a small body-mass index) is considered attractive. The fashion industry has been attempting to cater to this trend by designing outfits that can enhance the appearance of slimness. Two anecdotal rules, widespread in the world of fashion, are to choose dark clothes and avoid horizontal stripes, in order to appear slim. Thus far, empirical evidence has been unable to conclusively determine the validity of these rules, and there is consequently much controversy regarding the impact of both color and patterns on the visual perception of weight. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by presenting the results from a series of large-scale crowdsourcing studies that investigate the above two claims. We gathered a dataset of around 1000 images of people from the Web together with their ground-truth weight and height as well as clothing attributes about colors and patterns. To elicit the effects of colors and patterns, we asked crowd workers to estimate the weight in each image. For the analysis, we controlled potential confounds by matching images in pairs where the two images differ with respect to color or pattern, but are similar with respect to other relevant aspects. We created image pairs in two ways: firstly, observationally, i.e., from two real images; and secondly, experimentally, by manipulating the color or pattern of clothing in a real image via photo editing. Based on our analysis, we conclude that dark clothes indeed decrease perceived weight slightly but statistically significantly, and horizontal stripes have no discernible effect compared to solid light-colored clothes. These results contribute to advancing the debate around the effect of specific clothing colors and patterns and thus provide empirical grounds for everyday fashion decisions. Moreover, our work gives an outlook on the vast opportunities of using crowd sourcing in the modern fashion industry.",clothing;fashion;weight perception;body size;crowdsourcing,,"Technische Universität München (TUM); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA; EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"
2068,E-Cube: Energy-efficient UAV Trajectory Scheduling with Height and Speed Optimization,Z. Zhou; Z. Ma; M. Zhao; K. Zheng,2021,2021 International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing (SAGC),IEEE Conferences,1,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in data collection from IoT ground nodes (GNs) in different wild areas and scenarios, such as visiting GNs on electrical transmission towers along the mountains, or flood monitoring GNs on the banks along the rivers. However, limited battery capacity greatly restricts the performance of UAV in above applications. In this paper, we propose E-Cube, a UAV energy optimization scheme that jointly considers speed and height scheduling. E-Cube first decomposes the UAV spatial motion in terrain with altitude fluctuation into the horizontal plane and the vertical plane for energy efficient solutions. On the horizontal plane, E-Cube performs a Speed-Sensitive Trajectory Selection Algorithm (STSA), which is based on a practical energy model, to schedule the speed and select the distance accumulation trajectory. For the method on the vertical plane, an Altitude-Sensitive Trajectory Selection Algorithm (ATSA) is adapted to select the trajectory with the minimum height changes greedily based on the local information and then optimizes energy consumption for flight control by reducing speed varying based on the global information. E-Cube is evaluated through a series of experiments, and the results demonstrate that E-Cube can save as much as 25.1% energy consumption on average compared to existed approaches.",Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;energy efficiency;speed and height scheduling;trajectory planning,,"School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"

This paper presents a novel dynamic modelling method to investigate the deformation modal properties of a vertical stretch-retractable continuum manipulator (VSRCM) under the tip horizontal load. Based on the equivalence of the elastic bending potential energy, this method simplifies the backbone continuum manipulator to a single beam, an equivalent-guided beam (EGB). One end of the EGB is fixed, and the other end is guided. The modal dynamics model of the EGB is then established by employing the vibration theory of a continuous beam, and the modal properties of the continuum manipulator are analyzed. Static and Dynamic experiments of the VSRCM are performed to validate the dynamic modeling method through the comparison and analysis of the free dynamic response and frequency properties of the continuum manipulator. To analyze the free dynamic response, the large deflection static model with tip horizontal load is also established based on the elliptic integral approach. Experimental results and comparison demonstrate that the static model is efficient and precise to predict the large deformation, and the modal dynamic models well reflect the actual vibration modal characteristics of the VSRCM.",,,"engineering department of Aarhu University, University of Technology; Mechanical Engineering and Applied Electronics Technology of Beijing, University of Technology; robotics of Bejing, Union University; engineering department, Aarhu University"

For horizontal positioning, the UWB-based positioning technology was used to ensure the UAV positioning when the GPS signals were blocked; the smooth processing was employed in the sensor fusion between the GPS and UWB for seamless switchover between these two modes. For vertical positioning, the fusion of an millimeter wave (MMW) radar, a barometer, and an accelerometer improved the elevation measurement and control accuracy of the UAV, ensuring the auto focusing and clear imaging of the long-focal-length camera.

2072,A Study on Artificial Kinesthesia Generation by Simultaneous Stimulation of Mechanical Vibration and Mechanical Skin Stretch,K. Maemura; S. Nishikawa; K. Kiguchi,2022,2022 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR),IEEE Conferences,0,"Artificially controlled kinesthesia can be applied to many situations because kinesthesia is essential to recognizing body movements. It could be used to generate artificial kinesthesia in rehabilitation or daily motion assist to improve self-efficacy of the robot user. Moreover, the controlled artificial kinesthesia could make people feel as if they are performing the actions of the robotic limbs with their own limbs. Mechanical vibration stimulation is one of the candidates to artificially control kinesthesia. It is known that mechanical vibration stimulation on human muscles or tendons from skin surface evokes an illusion of movement as if the stimulated muscles are extended. That effect of artificial kinesthesia is called Kinesthetic Illusion (KI). In this paper, a method to increase the amount of KI without changing the frequency of the vibration stimulation is investigated by applying mechanical skin stretch stimulation at the same time with the mechanical vibration stimulation. The experiment was conducted by generating KI for flexion motion of the elbow joint on a horizontal plane to evaluate the proposed approach. In the experiments, three out of five subjects showed obvious increase in the amount of KI when skin stretch stimulation was applied at the same time with the mechanical vibration stimulation. The results of this study provide a first step toward artificial kinesthesia control using a wearable robotic device using the mechanical vibration stimulation.",,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"
2073,A New Approach of Digital Orthorectification Map Generation for GF3 Satellite Data,L. Guo; X. Wang; Y. Wang; M. Yue,2019,2019 6th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR),IEEE Conferences,1,"The successful launch of GF3 satellite has achieved long-term, sustained and stable acquisition of DOM product all over the China, however, it is a difficult project to deploy angle transmitter or select the same image points between SAR image and optical image manually, which only suitable for SAR image in some small areas, and cannot meet the needs of production and engineering application in large areas. In order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of surveying and mapping, a new approach of DOM product generation in large areas was proposed in this paper, which can automatically achieve the process of heterogeneous data matching of SAR data based on the optical DOM reference map and the process of dodging and mosaic line editing. 100 scenes of SLC image of GF3 satellite with the FSII imaging mode covering a large area and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were selected as experimental image, by the heterogeneous data matching, high-precise control points and link points were automatically acquired, and the block adjustment of GF3 data in the experimental area was completed. The RMSE of all control points and link points in azimuth direction was better than 0.41 pixels, the RMSE in range direction was better than 0.85 pixels, and the maximum error was better than 3 pixels. According to the requirement of quality examination, based on the ZY3-DOM data, 5 checkpoints were well-distributed selected for each scene of image. The experimental results showed that the horizontal accuracy of 66% of image orthorectification result were better than 1 pixel (10 m), and 34% of image orthorectification result were better than 2 pixels (20 m), in which the accuracy between 10 and 20 meters were mountain or high-mountain terrain. And the GF3 orthorectification result can meet the horizontal accuracy requirement of 1:50000 scale surveying and mapping in China. At the same time, for the orthorectification result of 100 scenes of GF3 data, dodging and mosaic line were automatically generated and processed, and appropriate dodging points were added to adjust the grey value of one or both sides of image. It can be seen from this article that the hue transition of whole experimental area was more natural, there was no obvious hue difference, and the amount of manual editing was not big.

GF-7 is also equipped with a laser altimeter, which can obtain sparse laser altimetry points (LAPs) to improve the vertical accuracy of stereo images. Verifying the geometric accuracy of GF-7 imagery without ground-control points (GCPs) is of great significance for evaluating the mapping capability of GF-7. In this study, 147 stereo images and 804 LAPs of the GF-7 satellite covering Jiangsu Province, Hebei Province, and Sichuan Province in China were selected as experimental data. Subsequently, 455 high-precision independent check points were used to verify the geometric accuracy of the GF-7 images.

Results: The decoder performed well for both healthy and stroke populations. As movement smoothness decreased, decoding performance decreased for the stroke population.

Morton,2023,2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,2,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) also commonly known as drones, are increasingly being used in many industries as they capable of accessing areas that are difficult to reach or are remote. However, due to limitations in the payload's reachability the same level work that a human in a similar location cannot be completed. To address this issue, this paper presents the implementation of a robotic manipulator on a UAV which can extend the reachability beyond the normal constraints of the UAV. Many designs of robotic manipulators underneath the UA V have been previously proposed. However, limited designs explore the use of a manipulator mounted to the top of the U A V. This is due to the instabilities that occur as the Centre of Gravity (CoG) is raised. Different methods have been proposed in literature to combat this, ranging from integrating the arm movements with the control systems of the UAV (autopilot), to designs that balance the CoG mechanically. This paper describes the design and implementation of a top mounted pantographic manipulator. Small changes in CoG will be controlled by the UAV's autopilot. The manipulator implemented is a novel design that is able to control the CoG mechanically. The design operates similar to a car jack with the end effector and counterbalance moving in an equal and opposite motion. Through bench and flight testing it was found that the manipulator can mitigate horizontal CoG movements whilst the end effector was moved with an appropriate reachability. The system is demonstrated through flight experiments and shows the feasibility of a top mounted manipulator on a UAV.

Current photonic convolutional processors transform tensor convolutions into multi-channel general matrix multiplication (GeMM), which follows the path of electronic counterparts, leading to data replication and hardware complexity. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a photonic tensor processing unit (PTPU) with a single modulator, which offers a more concise approach for multi-channel standard tensor convolution processing, different from the channel-wise convolution method. By executing multi-tensor parallel computing instead of multi-channel parallel computing, PTPU can directly produce feature tensors without clock synchronization and delay compensation between multiple channels and allows more release of physical hardware resources.

Saradhi,2023,2023 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking (ICPCSN),IEEE Conferences,0,"Pick and place robots are now extensively utilised in modern manufacturing facilities. The process of picking up the components or things and putting them in new locations is sped up by pick and place automation. The production rates of these processes can be raised by automating them. Decide and choose Robots handle monotonous tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more challenging jobs. The food processing and packaging sector is expanding quickly. Manufacturers are utilising robotics to complete operations that would otherwise require dedicated physical labour to satisfy the increased demands and necessary efficiency. One of the most often used automation devices in the food packing environment is the pick and place robot. It is a disruptive brain ailment called Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since there is presently no treatment for it, early diagnosis is essential to both preventing and slowing the spread of the illness. In order to interpret AD utilising brain MRI scans and powerful deep learning models that can accurately find the areas of anomalies using medically validated bio-markers, this research conducts a comparison analysis.[16]. The process of analysing data, learning from that data, and using what has been learned to make decisions is known as machine learning. Indeed, machine learning is a subset of deep learning. Whilst it theoretically falls under the category of machine learning and operates similarly, it has various characteristics [17]. It can be a cylindrical robot that can move in all three planes of motion-horizontal, vertical, and rotational—or a spherical robot that can move in two planes of rotation and one plane of linear motion. It can also be an articulated robot or a scara robot (fixed robots with 3 vertical axes rotary arms).

2082,Fractional Fuzzy Inference System: The New Generation of Fuzzy Inference Systems,M. Mazandarani; X. Li,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,12,"This paper presents a new machinery of compositional rule of inference called fractional fuzzy inference system (FFIS). An FFIS is a fuzzy inference system (FIS) in which consequent parts of a rule base consist of a new type of membership functions called fractional membership functions. Fractional membership functions are characterized using fractional indices. There are two types of fractional indices. Each type can be either constant or dynamic. An FFIS intelligently considers not only the truth degrees of information included in membership functions, but also the volume of the information in the process of making a conclusion. In other words, the volume of information extracted from a membership function depends on the truth degree of information. Concretely, the higher the truth degree, the larger the volume of information that is involved in the process of making a conclusion. It is shown that typical FISs, e.g. Mamdani's or Larsen's FISs, are special cases of FFISs. Specifically, as the fractional indices approach one, the FFIS approaches a typical FIS. In addition, using two theorems proved in this paper, it is demonstrated that, independent of the problem in question, a typical FIS never leads to results which are more satisfactory than those obtained by the FFIS corresponding to the typical FIS provided that a particular set of fractional indices is taken into account. Put another way, it seems sound to expect that applying FFIS always leads to more satisfactory results than applying its corresponding FIS. It is also shown that FFIS grants a special dynamic to FIS which can be also customized according to a new concept called reaction trajectories map (RTM). Particularly, the RTM enables decision makers to select an FFIS more suitable for their purpose. Some more concepts such as the left and right orders of an FFIS and the fracture index are also introduced in this paper.",Fractional membership functions;fractional horizontal membership functions;fractional compositional rule of inference;fractional indices;reaction trajectories map;fractional translation rule,,"Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, China; Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"

Zhang,2023,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,IEEE Journals,2,"Wireless charging for autonomous underwater vehicles has been widely explored recently by the merit of safety and convenience. However, due to the misalignment between charging coils in the horizontal and vertical directions, the system may not maintain constant current or constant voltage output. Therefore, this article proposes a mistuned inductive power transfer (IPT) system structure and corresponding design methods to improve misalignment tolerance. The proposed IPT system adopts series–series compensation and includes a variable inductor (VI) on the secondary side. A general design method based on the established mathematical model is proposed. The worst scenarios (i.e., the maximum value of misalignment) are used for the optimization of the system parameters. The control strategy for VI without any communication link to the primary side is established. Finally, a 1-kW IPT system for tolerance of k of 0.15–0.5 and output voltage of 74–150 V variation is set up. The experimental results show that the horizontal and vertical direction misalignment ranges reach ±47% and +140%, respectively, and the maximum system efficiency exceeds 96% for full power output.

2084,Hierarchical Scaling of Microservices in Kubernetes,F. Rossi; V. Cardellini; F. L. Presti,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS),IEEE Conferences,18,"In the last years, we have seen the increasing adoption of the microservice architectural style where applications satisfy user requests by invoking a set of independently deployable services. Software containers and orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, have simplified the development and management of microservices. To manage containers' horizontal elasticity, Kubernetes uses a decentralized threshold-based policy that requires to set thresholds on system-oriented metrics (i.e., CPU utilization). This might not be well-suited to scale latency-sensitive applications, which need to express requirements in terms of response time. Moreover, being a fully decentralized solution, it may lead to frequent and uncoordinated application reconfigurations. In this paper, we present me-kube (Multi-level Elastic Kubernetes), a Kubernetes extension that introduces a hierarchical architecture for controlling the elasticity of microservice-based applications. At higher level, a centralized per-application component coordinates the run-time adaptation of subordinated distributed components, which, in turn, locally control the adaptation of each microservice. Then, we propose novel proactive and reactive hierarchical control policies, based on queuing theory. To show that me-kube provides general mechanisms, we also integrate reinforcement learning-based scaling policies. Using me-kube, we perform a large set of experiments, aimed to show the advantages of a hierarchical control over the default Kubernetes autoscaler.",Container;Elasticity;Hierarchical control;Kubernetes;Microservices;Self-adaptation,,"DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy; DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy; DICII, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy"

Shen,2019,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,IEEE Journals,62,"A drone base station (DBS) is a promising technique to extend wireless connections for uncovered users of terrestrial radio access networks (RANs). To improve user fairness and network performance, in this paper, we design three-dimensional (3-D) trajectories of multiple DBSs in the drone-assisted RANs, where DBSs fly over associated areas of interests (AoIs) and relay communications between the base station and users in AoIs. We formulate the multi-DBS 3-D trajectory planning and scheduling as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem with the objective of minimizing the average DBS-to-user (D2U) pathloss. The 3-D trajectory variations in both horizontal and vertical directions, as well as the state-of-the-art DBS-related channel models, are considered in the formulation. To address the non-convexity and NP-hardness of the MINLP problem, we first decouple it into multiple integer linear programming and quasi-convex sub-problems in which AoI association, D2U communication scheduling, horizontal trajectories, and flying heights of DBSs are, respectively, optimized. Then, we design a multi-DBS 3-D trajectory planning and scheduling algorithm to solve the sub-problems iteratively based on the block coordinate descent method. A k-means-based initial trajectory generation and a search-based start slot scheduling are considered in the proposed algorithm to improve trajectory design performance and ensure the inter-DBS distance constraint, respectively. Extensive simulations are conducted to investigate the impacts of DBS quantity, horizontal speed, and initial trajectory on the trajectory planning results. Compared with the static DBS deployment, the proposed trajectory planning can achieve 10-15 dB reduction on average D2U pathloss and reduce the D2U pathloss standard deviation by 68%, which indicate the improvements of network performance and user fairness.",Drone communication;drone base station;trajectory planning;DA-RAN;space-air-ground integration,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; School of Telecommunication, Xidian University, Xi’an, China; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"

Keeler,2020,2020 AIAA/IEEE 39th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Detect and avoid (DAA) systems provide unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with an alternative means of compliance with the see-and-avoid requirements associated with operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). Previous studies have examined the efficacy of different DAA alerting and guidance structures and formats. Prior research has also investigated the integration of DAA information with the alerting and guidance generated by the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II). The next-generation replacement for TCAS II - the Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X) - includes a variant to be used by UAS (ACAS Xu) that will provide both DAA and Collision Avoidance (CA) guidance. The alerting and guidance issued by ACAS Xu differs from previous DAA and CA systems, a result of new capabilities that were not available to earlier systems. Differences include the removal of warning-level DAA alerting and guidance, as well as the issuance of new types of CA guidance, referred to as Resolution Advisories (RAs). Whereas TCAS II only issues vertical RAs, ACAS Xu adds horizontal and blended (i.e., simultaneous vertical and horizontal) RAs. The current study assessed pilots' ability to respond to and comply with the DAA and RA alerting and guidance generated by ACAS Xu in a human-in-the-loop simulation. Sixteen active UAS pilots participated in the study and were tasked with responding to scripted DAA and RA traffic conflicts. Results showed that pilots were effective at making timely maneuvers against DAA threats. The proportion of losses of DAA well clear against noncooperative intruders was found to be significantly higher than the proportion of losses against cooperative intruders, a result of the limited declaration range of the simulated onboard RADAR. Results also demonstrated that pilots could consistently meet the five second response time requirement for initial RAs. Rapid responses to RAs had the corresponding effect of minimizing the severity of losses of DAA well clear. While pilots complied with initial RAs at a high rate, compliance dropped substantially when the target heading was updated during a horizontal RA. Pilot performance with ACAS Xu will be presented alongside results from prior DAA research.",unmanned aircraft systems;detect and avoid;collision avoidance,,"Human Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; Human Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; Human Systems Division, San José State University, Moffett Field, CA; Human Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; Human Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; Human Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA"

Prasanna,2019,2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR),IEEE Conferences,1,"Handwriting production is a complex mechanism of fine motor control, associated with mainly two degrees of freedom in the horizontal and vertical directions. The relation between the horizontal and vertical velocities depends on the trajectory shape and its length. In this work, we explore the generation of handwriting velocities using two sinusoidal oscillations. The proposed method follows the motor equivalence theory and considers that the patterns are stored in the form of a sequence of corner shapes and its relative location in the letter. These points are referred to as the modulation points, where the parameters of the sinusoidal oscillations are modulated to generate required velocity profiles. Depending on the location and shape of the corners, the amplitude, phase, and frequency relations between the two underlying oscillations are changed. Accordingly, this paper presents an efficient method to synthesize the velocity profiles and hence the handwriting. Further, the shape variability in the synthesized data can also be introduced by modifying the position of the modulation points and its corner shapes. The quality of the synthesized handwriting is evaluated using both subjective and quantitative evaluation methods.",Handwriting synthesis;Oscillatory theory,,"Dept. of EEE, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India; Dept. of EEE, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"
2088,Master-slave UAV-assisted WSNs for Improving Data Collection Rate and Shortening Flight Time,H. Zhang; Y. Tao; X. Lv; Y. Liu,2023,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"In UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks (WSNs), most schemes use a single UAV to collect one regional sensors’ data or multi-UAVs independently work in multi-regions for time-sensitive fixed-ground-trajectory scenarios. To our best knowledge, they are a single-objective performance enhancement scheme, such as improving data collection rate or shortening flight time. Moreover, these two objectives are contradictory. To address this problem, we propose master-slave UAV data collection algorithm (MSUDC) that is a joint framework with trajectory adjustment and air-to-ground (A2G) cooperation. MSUDC could simultaneously improve data collection rate and shorten flight time. There is little research about double-objective performance enhancement schemes like MSUDC, as far as we know. Through air-to-air (A2A) communication link, master UAV controls slave UAV trajectory adjustment. Therefore, the flight formation of master-slave UAVs could build a new shape of covered communication area on the ground. Unlike present work, the overlapped area makes their sensors have at most two times to transmit data. Besides, master-slave UAVs realize priority grouping of sensors according to connection time and use centralized control methods to make sensors in one priority group send data according to their command. This effectively avoids data collisions. Generally, the priority group and centralized control methods are different from most existing research. MSUDC outperforms single and double UAV data collection algorithms, which is robust for changing the horizontal minimum speed of master-slave UAVs. Through MSUDC, we find a new technological roadmap for our future multi-objective performance enhancement. However, the limitation of MSUDC is the high cost of master-slave UAVs.",Master-slave UAVs trajectory adjustment;double-objective performance enhancement;wireless sensor networks;UAV-assisted WSNs;mobile sink-based WSNs,,"Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"

We demonstrate that a patch antenna can be replaced by a set of rectangular loops and sets of horizontal line dipoles, all located in a vacuum. When the relative permittivity of the substrate is close to one, the horizontal dipoles dominate, and the radiation in the horizontal directions is negligible. In contrast, when the relative permittivity is high, the radiation pattern of the antenna resembles the pattern of a loop placed perpendicularly to the ground plane. The developed models explain the gain reduction due to the presence of the dielectric of up to around 4.3 dB (compared with the antenna in a vacuum), which we have confirmed numerically. Another contribution of this paper is the derivation of a simple formula for the gain as a function of the substrate permittivity.

The monitoring of slug flows allows for proper control and safety in many operations in the oil and gas industry. In recent years, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a promising technology for industrial use and is applied here for flow monitoring. Namely, this article introduces the use of DAS for the measurement of slug flow. A number of flow configurations under controlled conditions are investigated. Measurements were carried out in a 9-m horizontal pipeline Section in a flow-loop laboratory. Fiber optics were helically wrapped along the outer surface of the pipeline to promote higher sensitivity at a higher spatial resolution space. The velocity of the gas phase given by the elongated bubbles velocity is estimated from DAS data through radial integration in  ${k}$ – ${f}$  space and distributed cross correlation methods. Using measurements from a commercial conductance-based sensor as a reference, the results showed the root-mean-square deviation in % (RMSD%) of 8.34% and 12.18%.

Lithography scaling enabled CMOS to compete in high-performance computing subsequently. Dennard's 1974 summary on CMOS scaling principle further offered the microelectronics industry a scientific scaling direction according to Moore's Law. By 2005, Dennard scaling principle, however, largely broke down due to the subthreshold leakage on planar MOSFET which prevented the Vth, Vdd, and frequency to scale. Double-gate (SOI), and tri-gate (FinFET) were invented to allow the channel to be better controlled so carriers won't escape to the substrate. A gate-all-around (e.g.: nano-wire and nano-sheet) MOSFET has the channel surrounded by gate electrode with even better electrostatic control, leading to leakage reduction and improved carrier mobility. With multi nano-sheets, the effective W (W_eff) in a unit area is also improved, allowing moderate density scaling compared to FinFet devices. More improvement for CMOS scaling is on the horizon by the industry. ForkFET, which uses a barrier layer between PMOS and NMOS, allows the PMOS and NMOS to be placed closer to each other, thus improving transistor density and reducing interconnect RC between PMOS and NMOS. Complementary FET (CFET), which has PMOS and NMOS stacked on top of each other, reduces the interconnect between PMOS and NMOS significantly as the interconnect on vertical stacking is much shorter than horizontal wiring. Future technology advancement may allow more layers of MOSFETs to be manufactured monolithically (Monolithic 3D integration), when thermal and testability challenges are better solved [1]–[9].",,,Cheng-Hsiang Hsieh TSMC Inc.; Cheng-Hsiang Hsieh TSMC Inc.; Cheng-Hsiang Hsieh TSMC Inc.; Cheng-Hsiang Hsieh TSMC Inc.

Tripp,2020,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,IEEE Journals,3,"Much recent work in grasp planning has focused on data-driven approaches, using deep learning to map from images to gripper configurations. However, this approach typically fails about once per ten attempts, limiting its practicality. We sought to better understand the degree to which such failures can be attributed to hardware versus control. To this end, we developed a naturalistic grasp demonstration system in which a gripper was fitted with a handle and moved by a human operator, while its trajectory was recorded with a motion tracker. The gripper's fingers were controlled with a joystick. We recorded roughly 37 K grasp demonstrations with this system. These grasps were almost always successful. In contrast with planar grasp planners that perform only top-down grasps by design, many of the human-planned grasps used a horizontal approach rather than a top-down approach. We analysed robustness ofa subset of these human-planned grasps, and found that many were robust to gripper rotations of about π/8 radians and translations of 3 cm (depending on the object). Consistent with past work, human operators tended to align the gripper aperture with objects' principal axes. We also tested robustness of grasps in which the gripper aperture was aligned exactly with the principal axes, and found that these heuristic grasps were even more robust than human-planned grasps. This suggests that humans used a partly symbolic grasp planning strategy, with somewhat imprecise control.",Robot learning;robot control;manipulators;grasping,,"Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"

The accuracy of damage detection directly affects the safety of railway transportation systems. Rail damage detection, identification and classification are the key to ultrasonic flaw detection systems. At present, most of the researches focus on the local damage of rails, such as rail head nuclear damage, rail waist cracks, or through holes at the bottom of the rail. The classification and identification of typical damages of the entire rail have not been systematically studied. In this paper six features are extracted by principal component analysis(PCA), they are the ratio of the energy of the signal processed by wavelet decomposition, the area surrounded by the 100-150 sampling points and the horizontal axis, the maximum amplitude and its position of the 100-150 sampling points, and the maximum amplitude in the 240-300 sampling points, and the position in the 300-400 sampling points, which are used to present the characteristics of the rail damage. Least square support vector machine (LSSVM) is introduced to create the classification analysis models, the eigenvalues extracted by PCA are the input of the models and any rail damage is the expectation output. In order to improve the accuracy of the classification models, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of the model, seven classification analysis models of the rail damage are built.

When the TRDMR is suspended from the rope on the façade, a function is needed to overcome the obstacle, and the additional moment generated in the working environment tilts the pitch angle and destabilizes the robot system. In this study,a new mechanism for overcoming obstacles and stabilizing posture for TRDMR is proposed. The pitch angle of the TRDMR can be controlled using the rope tension slider (RTS), which controls the point at which the tension of the rope acts on the robot. Therefore, it is possible to overcome obstacles of various heights and maintain a stabilized posture by completely adhering to the façade with only one actuator having a simple structure. Static and kinematic analysis were performed to know the position of the tension point to overcome the 300 mm obstacle, and the maximum additional moment that can maintain a stabilized posture when using the RTS was calculated through static analysis. It was verified that TRDMR with RTS can overcome a 300 mm obstacle on a 5.6 m high test bench. When an additional moment of approximately −75 Nm was applied, in the case of TRDMR without RTS, the pitch angle was inclined by −9.56$^\circ$.

Matolak,2019,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,17,"This paper presents an experimental study of the air-to-ground (AG) propagation channel through ultrawideband (UWB) measurements in an open area using unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs). Measurements were performed using UWB radios operating in the frequency range of 3.1 GHz-4.8 GHz and UWB planar elliptical dipole antennas having an omni-directional pattern in the azimuth plane and typical donut shaped pattern in the elevation plane. Three scenarios were considered for the channel measurements: (i) two receivers (RXs) at different heights above the ground and placed close to each other in line-of-sight (LOS) with the transmitter (TX) on the UAV and the UAV is hovering; (ii) RXs in obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) with the UAV TX due to foliage, and the UAV is hovering; and, (iii) UAV moving in a circular path. Different horizontal and vertical distances between the RXs and the TX were used in the measurements. In addition, two different antenna orientations were used on the UAV antennas (vertical and horizontal) to analyze the effects of antenna radiation patterns on the UWB AG propagation. From the empirical results, it was observed that the received power depends mainly on the antenna radiation pattern in the elevation plane when the antennas are oriented in the same direction, as expected for these omni-azimuth antennas. Moreover, the overall antenna gain at the TX and RX can be approximated using trigonometric functions of the elevation angle. The antenna orientation (polarization) mismatch increases path loss, and produces a larger number of weak multipath components (MPCs) than when aligned. Similarly, additional path loss and a larger number of MPCs were observed for the OLOS scenario. In the case of the UAV moving in a circular path, the antenna orientation mismatch has smaller effects on the path loss than when the UAV is hovering, because a larger number of cross polarized components are received during motion.

Pietrosimone; M. L. Palmeri; K. R. Nightingale,2022,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",IEEE Journals,3,"Ultrasonic rotational 3-D shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) has been used to induce and evaluate multiple shear wave modes, including both the shear horizontal (SH) and shear vertical (SV) modes in in vivo muscle. Observations of both the SH and SV modes allow the muscle to be characterized as an elastic, incompressible, transversely isotropic (ITI) material with three parameters: the longitudinal shear modulus  $\mu _{L}$ , the transverse shear modulus  $\mu _{T}$ , and the tensile anisotropy  $\chi _{E}$ . Measurement of the SV wave is necessary to characterize  $\chi _{E}$ , but the factors that influence SV mode generation and characterization with ultrasonic SWEI are complicated. This work uses Green’s function (GF) simulations to perform a parametric analysis to determine the optimal interrogation parameters to facilitate visualization and quantification of SV mode shear waves in muscle. We evaluate the impact of five factors:  $\mu _{L}$ ,  $\mu _{T}$ ,  $\chi _{E}$ , fiber tilt angle  $\theta _{\text {tilt}}$ , and F-number of the push geometry on SV mode speed, amplitude, and rotational distribution. These analyses demonstrate that the following hold: 1) as  $\mu _{L}$  increases, SV waves decrease in amplitude so are more difficult to measure in SWEI imaging; 2) as  $\mu _{T}$  increases, the SV wave speeds increase; 3) as  $\chi _{E}$  increases, the SV waves increase in speed and separate from the SH waves; 4) as fiber tilt angle  $\theta _{\text {tilt}}$  increases, the measurable SV waves remain approximately the same speed, but change in strength and in rotational distribution; and 5) as the push beam geometry changes with F-number, the measurable SV waves remain approximately the same speed, but change in strength and rotational distribution. While specific SV mode speeds depend on the combinations of all parameters considered, measurable SV waves can be generated and characterized across the range of parameters considered. To maximize measurable SV waves separate from the SH waves, it is recommended to use an  ${F}/{1}$  push geometry and  $\theta _{\text {tilt}} = {15}^{\circ} $ .",Muscle;shear wave elastography;transverse isotropy,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Duke Orthopaedic Surgery and Department of Physical Therapy, Duke University Health System, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"

However, most flapping robots require an operator or an assistance device to take off. The goal of this study was to develop a flapping robot that can achieve self-takeoff without running and can be used like a drone. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the flapping robot developed with this aim. The developed robot can generate a thrust that exceeds its own weight with a simple flapping mechanism and a lightweight design. The airspeed was simulated using the thrust measured with a force sensor and the resistance coefficient estimated in a gliding experiment, and it was found to exceed the minimum airspeed required to achieve takeoff 0.3 s from the onset of flapping. The result of the takeoff experiment demonstrated that takeoff was possible if the initial pitch angle was high. However, the pitch angle decreased immediately after takeoff due to the pitching moment generated by the flapping motion. The moment on the tail wing was not enough for the robot to maintain a horizontal posture at low airspeeds during takeoff. It was concluded that the robot requires a control mechanism for the pitching moment generated by the flapping motion and/or accelerators that function without flapping during takeoff, such as hind limbs. Therefore, the parameters required for the design of actuated hind limbs were estimated.",Flapping robot;Self-takeoff;Micro aerial vehicle,,Tokyo Metropolitan University; Tokyo Metropolitan University; Tokyo Metropolitan University

A control strategy that utilises the coupled nature of the attractive normal and linear thrust forces has been developed that focuses on achieving adhesion to a non-horizontal surface as well as peak thrust for given structural and operational parameters. The developed vehicle has a total mass of 28kg and has been experimentally tested to develop a peak thrust force from standstill of 90N for an input power of 1.7kW by switching 220V supply at 10-20Hz. Analysis shows that the vehicle generates the greatest force with a slip frequency between 10–20 Hz, that the greatest normal force of 518N at 5Hz was developed when climbing at 121°, and 11W is lost in the reaction plate through 3A/mm2 eddy currents.

Tseng; Y. -C. Tien; P. -C. Hsu,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,34,"With the increasing demands for seamless landvehicle navigation, systems with robust performance are required in highly urbanized areas. The traditional INS/GNSS integration is widely applied to solve this issue. However, the system still suffers from bad GNSS signal reception and INS time accumulated errors that seamlessness and stability are difficult to maintain. In this study, the performance of the low cost INS/GNSS with aiding sensors, such as an odometer and barometer, was evaluated for both the loosely-coupled (LC) scheme and tightly-coupled (TC) scheme. Moreover, considering barometric error accumulation, a vehicle-behavior based drift control method has been proposed. An experiment was conducted under harsh GNSS-degraded scenarios to assess the characteristics and performance for different sensor combinations, using single constellation (GPS) with single-frequency (L1 band) measurement. Overall, the TC scheme without additional strategies in detecting abnormal measurement encounters more challenges to achieve stable performance. In an INS/GNSS/barometer system with the proposed drift control method, error accumulation under unpredictable environmental changes was successfully mitigated in both schemes. The proposed method can maintain a height accuracy of 2-meter level root mean square even after a long term operation. In an INS/GNSS/odometer combination, improvements were observed in the horizontal and vertical direction for both schemes. According to statistical analysis, an INS/GNSS/odometer/barometercombination shows 16.57% and 6.11% in the horizontal, and 30.71% and 71.28% in the vertical for the LC scheme and TC scheme, compared with an INS/GNSS combination.",Loosely coupled (LC);tightly coupled (TC);inertial navigation system and global navigation satellite system (INS/GNSS);non-line-of-sight (NLOS);odometer;barometer,,"Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Allystar Technology Company Limited, Shenzhen, China; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"

In this article, we call these vine robots because of their similarity to plants in their growth-trailing behavior. Due to their growth-based movement, vine robots are well suited for navigation and exploration in cluttered environments. Until now, however, they have not been deployed outside the lab. There are three features that are key for successful deployment in the field. First is portability. Second is the ability to be guided over long enough distances to be useful for navigation. Third is intuitive human-in-the-loop teleoperation, which enables movement in unknown and dynamic environments. We present a vine robot system that is teleoperated using a custom-designed flexible joystick and camera system, can extend long enough for use in navigation tasks, and is portable for use in the field. We report on the deployment of this system in two scenarios: completion of a soft robot navigation competition and exploration of an archaeological site. The competition course required movement over uneven terrain, past unstable obstacles, and through a small aperture. The archeological site required movement over rocks and through horizontal and vertical turns.

It deploys a planar feed which comprises a cross-shaped feed line, four coupled strips, and four curved arms with end-shorted stubs. The TE $_{011+\delta }$  mode of the DRA is excited by the curved arms. Its intrinsically narrow impedance bandwidth is enhanced by using the coupled strips, and the cross-polar field is suppressed by the end-shorted stubs. The antenna has a measured −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 18.1%, which is much wider than the conventional bandwidths of 4.5%–7.4%. Its cross-polar level is lower than the co-polar level by 15 dB. This basic DRA is used to design the first polarization reconfigurable omnidirectional DRA with diodes. By controlling the states of the diodes, the DRA can be switched between TE $_{011+\delta }$  and TM $_{01\delta }$  modes to obtain horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively. To verify the idea, a prototype was fabricated and tested. Reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is obtained.

Hjertaker,2021,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,IEEE Journals,7,"This work assesses the accuracy of two-phase flow measurement, based on cross correlation (XC) and cross-spectrum (CS) velocity computation, using dual plane nonintrusive electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), over a broad spectrum of horizontal flow configurations, combined with fraction distribution measurements from gamma-ray tomography (GRT). The measurement of two-phase flow encompasses the measurement of both the velocity and the phase concentration of the flow components. The accuracy of the flow velocity is still an open discussion and remains a key challenge in the field of multiphase flow measurement. The velocities of the two-phase components vary, both in between them and across the pipe cross section. This study assesses the use of XC techniques as methods for calculating the cross-sectional velocity distribution by deriving the transit time of the fluid flowing through two parallel ECT sensor arrays mounted on the perimeter of a pipe. The spectral distribution of the velocities is assessed for improved accuracy of individual component velocities. A dual-plane ECT is adopted for the velocity measurements and is combined with state-of-the-art density-based cross-sectional phase fraction distribution from a GRT system to measure the volumetric flow rates of the two phases. The results show that the CS method provides enhanced velocity estimation for both flow phases over the conventional XC technique. Further improvement was reported using a simple predictive correction model resulting in flowrate estimation accuracy of ±10%.

The novel transducer consisted of 12 axially polarized sector magnets arranged in a circle, and the magnetic field directions of adjacent magnets were opposite. A spiral coil was arranged under the magnet array. A vertical magnetic field generated by the magnets and the circumferential eddy current generated by the spiral coil formed a Lorentz force in a plate acting in the radial direction of this new omnidirectional EMAT. By controlling the sizes of the sector magnets, the omnidirectional SH0 mode (fundamental SH guided wave mode) was generated. To maximize the output of the EMAT at the given excitation frequency, it was proposed to add acrylic spacers between the sector magnets and determine the size of the magnet based on the frequency bandwidth of the excitation signal while also optimizing the omnidirectional sound field. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of the EMAT was established using COMSOL Multiphysics to perform numerical simulations, and the effectiveness of the optimization method was verified.

Although many efforts have been devoted to beamforming with CCMAs, most existing methods consider only the 2-dimensional (2D) case and assume that the sound sources of interest are in the same plane as the sensor array (generally the horizontal plane), which often does not hold true in practical applications. This paper deals with the problem of beamforming with uniform CCMAs (UCCMAs) in the 3-dimensional (3D) space to control the steering of the spatial response and meanwhile form frequency-invariant beampatterns for processing broadband acoustic and speech signals. The major contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) it presents an analysis based on the spherical harmonics decomposition about the Nth-order optimal and steerable directivity patterns; 2) a beamforming method is developed in which the beamformer's coefficients are identified by solving a linear system of equations formed by approximating the Nth-order optimal target beampattern with the beamformer's beampattern while the resulting beampattern can be steered flexibly in the 3D space; 3) the sufficient and necessary condition on the array geometry and sensors' placement are given to ensure that the beamformer exists and is unique; and 4) the analytical forms of the directivity factor (DF) and white noise gain (WNG) of the resulting beamformer is given and discussion is presented on what conditions irregularities (deep nulls) in WNG and DF may occur.

Tehranipoor,2022,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,IEEE Journals,3,"The electronics supply chain has adapted into a global process over the past two decades to support the cost of process optimization. As the semiconductor industry has transitioned from a vertical to the horizontal business model, the perceived vulnerability of integrated circuit (IC) design, and fabrication has grown dramatically. Design intellectual property (IP) is the defining characteristic of most fabless design houses and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) within the supply chain, and as such, holds significant value for market competitiveness, and in some cases, national security. Malicious insiders threaten the confidentiality of this proprietary technology. To prevent IP piracy, we redefine the modern threat landscape by considering nearly every individual in the IC design and fabrication process untrusted. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to assure confidential electronic design against insider threats, termed ACED-IT, that enables maintaining the confidentiality of the design when it traverses through different design stages (e.g., RTL/Gate-level to GDSII). ACED-IT integrates encryption, logic locking, novel temporary-inserted logic elements (TILEs), access controls, and action logging, to protect the design IP from insider threats originating from any entity in the process. ACED-IT is compatible with the current industry development flow and provides all engineers with the tools to complete their roles. The proposed ACED-IT framework is demonstrated across various benchmarks and analyzed for security.

2152,ADWIL: A Zero-Overhead Analog Device Watermarking Using Inherent IP Features,U. Das; M. R. Muttaki; M. M. Tehranipoor; F. Farahmandi,2022,2022 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC),IEEE Conferences,2,"With the increased complexity of integrated circuits (ICs) and the fabrication processes at lower technology nodes, the semiconductor industry has largely shifted to a horizontal business model to minimize time-to-market and manufacturing costs. Due to outsourcing, the design house and third-party intellectual property (IP) owners lack control over the fabrication process, which can result in IP piracy, overuse, and counterfeiting. Watermarking is an approach to trace pirated parts back to the source by uniquely identifying IPs. In this paper, we introduce a novel watermarking technique, called ADWIL, using specific features and characteristics of the analog and mixed-signal (AMS) IP cores without modifying the target IP circuitry or its internal structure. Since the IP core remains unaltered, the watermark is very hard to detect and impossible to remove. Our experimental results on different op-amps demonstrate that watermark can be extracted reliably from target IP cores by using ADWIL.",IP piracy;counterfeiting;watermarking,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida"

2155,Adaptive Space-Time Equalization with Spatial Oversampling for Misaligned LoS MIMO,L. Giridhar; M. E. Rasekh; A. D. Sezer; U. Madhow,2022,2022 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC),IEEE Conferences,2,"Line-of-sight (LoS) millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach for providing the ultra-high speed point to point links required for wireless backhaul in picocellular networks. The combination of large bandwidth and spatial multiplexing can sustain 100+ Gbps links over 10s to 100s of meters, while the antenna form factors required for providing the necessary spatial degrees of freedom remain small due to the small carrier wavelength. However, the large bandwidth makes the system susceptible to geometric misalignments: relatively small misalignments can cause multi-symbol delay spread across the receiver aperture. Furthermore, as the signaling bandwidth approaches the limits of hardware (i.e., analog-to-digital converter (ADC)) capabilities, the temporal oversampling typically used to overcome intersymbol interference becomes infeasible. In this paper, we investigate an architecture for joint space-time equalization with spatial oversampling by introducing additional receive antennas while maintaining symbol-rate sampling. We consider linear space-time equalization, controlling complexity by employing an adaptive time window at each receiver. We illustrate tradeoffs between the size of the adaptive window and the spatial oversampling factor via analysis and simulation for a 4-stream, 128 Gbps, 100 m LoS link at 130 GHz with both horizontal and vertical misalignment of the 2D planar arrays.

Based on the specified bank modes, vertical and horizontal skew-cancel schemes for high density and an RBUS-based DBI ac to minimize data transition are newly proposed. Thus, the switching power of RBUS DBI ac is saved by 8.9% compared to that of DBI ac “OFF.” To improve the rank interleaving efficiency with a current increase, partially enabled WCK (PE-WCK) mode is proposed, which minimizes the number of enabled circuits for maintaining the WCK2CK synchronization. Therefore, the current can be saved by 62% without a timing constraint compared to the WCK always-ON mode. To achieve high-speed operation beyond 6.4 Gb/s, speed-boosting techniques, namely, the two-step duty corrector, active resonant load (ARL), and one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with offset calibration, are newly adopted. In the coarse step in the two-step duty corrector, the value of the duty error decreases to below 5% by suppressing the dc signal. In the fine step, the remaining duty error is further reduced within 2.5 ps by the duty cycle monitor (DCM) and duty cycle adjustor (DCA). Moreover, the skew increase beyond 6.4 Gb/s due to the bandwidth limit by the heavy loading of four-phase WCK signals is alleviated by the ARL, where the four-phase skew is within 5 ps irrespective of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. The direct feedback DFE enables fast feedback (<; 118 ps) for tap coefficient control, and offset calibration reduces the three-sigma offset of the four dynamic latches in DQ within 5 mV.",Active resonant load (ARL);DBI AC;duty cycle adjustor (DCA);duty cycle monitor;hybrid-bank architecture;one-tap DFE with offset calibration;partially enabled WCK (PE-WCK) mode;skew cancel scheme;two-step duty corrector;WCK bias calibration,,"Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea; Memory Division, DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea"
2157,A Method for Rapid Measurement of the Deformation and Spatial Attitude of Large Radar Antennas Inside Radomes,X. Guan; Y. Xu; C. Xing,2021,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,2,"It is challenging to measure, analyze, and control the deformation and space attitude of antennas in narrow radomes through geometric measurement to ensure the accuracy of phased array radar application. In this manuscript, a method for rapid measurement of antennas by adopting the combination of photogrammetry system, laser tracker and total station was proposed. The photogrammetric method was used with a homemade auxiliary tool to measure and calculate the antenna’s deformation under different temperatures and pitch angles. Mapping relations between the instrumental coordinate systems of photogrammetry system, laser tracker and total station were established through common points, including target balls and reflectors. Coordinates of mark points on antenna surface were converted from photogrammetric coordinate system to laser tracker’s and total station’s coordinate system. Thus, antenna’s pitch angles relative to the local horizontal plane and deflection angles relative to the north of the engineering coordinate system were calculated. Planar fitting, coordinate transformation and space attitude calculation were all carried out in the Spatial Analyzer (SA) software. The photogrammetric method detected the antenna’s gravitational deformation sensitively, the maximum Root Mean Square Residual (RMSR) of the reference length was  $54~\mu \text{m}$ , and that of the mark points was  $59~\mu \text{m}$ , which was stably in line with its nominal accuracy. Deviations caused by coordinate transformation had no significant effect on the calculation of antenna’s spatial attitude, for the maximum deviation between the converted and measured coordinates in laser tracker’s coordinate system was 0.139 mm, and that in total station’s coordinate system was 1.037 mm, both of which were within reasonable limits of the derived theoretical maximum deviations between different instruments. As a result, the maximum deviation between the calculated value and servo system’s nominal value of antenna’s pitch angle was  $59.4''$ , and that of antenna’s deflection angle was  $91.87''$ .

Furthermore, the air circulation technology is used to accelerate the water vapor mixing and eliminate the error caused by the water mist inhomogeneity.

The available data-set includes 22 patients that had undergone Open Partial Horizontal Laryngectomy (OPHL) of type II and 10 patients that had undergone OPHL of type III. A pre-processing algorithm that relies on the spectral kurtosis has been designed to remove non-harmonic frames from the available recordings of patients, thus minimizing the number of outliers among the extracted parameters. Such an algorithm has been tuned starting form the results of a control group of 10 healthy subjects. After this preliminary step, from the harmonic frames a series of parameters have been extracted that belong to spectral domain (tilt, kurtosis, entropy and Soft Phonation Index) and cepstral domain (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, MFCCs, and Cepstral Peak Prominence Smoothed, CPPS). Then, the patients have been subdivided into two classes according to the index I (Intelligibility) of the auditory perceptual scale INFVo and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-samples test has been run, which has highlighted that low-band MFCCs, spectral entropy and spectral kurtosis show the best discrimination capability of substitution voices. This outcome has been confirmed by an alternative method that is based on the performance of classification algorithms. A classification accuracy of about 81% has been obtained using a logistic regression model that was trained with median of MFCC3, range of MFCC4 and 95° percentiles of MFCC6 and MFCC9.

2166,Rigorous Density Correction Model for Single-Scan TLS Point Clouds,S. Liu; K. Tan; P. Tao; J. Yang; W. Zhang; Y. Wang,2023,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,0,"Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can acquire high-precision and high-resolution 3-D point clouds of the scanned targets, and the common technical challenge is how to accurately and efficiently process the massive unorganized point clouds. Density is one of the most fundamental and significant quantities that can be derived for each point by counting the number of neighbors in a given 3-D space. It contains key information of the target geometric features and thus plays an important role in TLS data processing (e.g., classification and feature extraction). However, density usually varies remarkably for different scenes with varied scan geometry (e.g., distance and incidence angle), scan resolution (e.g., horizontal and vertical angular resolutions), and object geometry (e.g., slope, size, and spatial attitude), thereby greatly hindering its full capability in reflecting the geometric discrepancies of different targets. The density must be corrected before reliably used as a proxy for target geometric features. In this study, a generalized rigorous model is proposed to correct the density of single-scan TLS point clouds based on the mathematically deduced relation between density and related influencing factors. The superiority of the proposed model over existing models is that it is rigorously developed based on the instrumental scanning principles and target spatial geometry and can be used for different instruments, scanning scenes, targets, and scanning parameters. The proposed model is verified by a series of indoor quantitative control experiments and three natural scenes with totally different instruments and scanning conditions. The results show that the proposed model can accurately simulate the density variation at different scanning geometries with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9957 between the calculated and actual densities. The effects of all influencing factors on density are significantly removed in complex natural scenes by the proposed model, where the coefficient of variation (CV) of the density from a homogeneous surface after correction is reduced by 72.31%, on the average. The proposed model exhibits good performance in terms of the feasibility, effectiveness, and generality and can derive a corrected density value that is a proxy of target geometric size. Additionally, the proposed model can be conducted on each scan individually before the coregistration in the actual TLS campaign with a number of single scans, which has tremendous application value in facilitating TLS data interpretation.",Density correction;density modeling;point cloud classification;point cloud density;terrestrial laser scanning (TLS),,"State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Geo-Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"

Liao,2022,2022 IEEE 12th International Conference Nanomaterials: Applications & Properties (NAP),IEEE Conferences,0,"Antibiotic resistance is one of the leading challenges to public health today, and a primary contributor to the rapid rise of resistance is plasmids, which facilitate the spread of multi-drug resistance genes within bacterial populations through horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, plasmids are critical targets to prevent the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance. In particular, low-copy number plasmids often contain toxin-antitoxin systems that act lethally when activated, so due to the role of toxin-antitoxin systems in facilitating internal cell death, the disruption of the protein-protein interaction between the toxin and the antitoxin may be a promising novel target for antibiotic development. Key interacting regions of the Kid-Kis toxin-antitoxin interaction were identified as binding sites for the de-novo design of small-molecule inhibitors using the webserver LEA3D. To predict the activity of novel inhibitors, a QSAR classification model was constructed with OCHEM using published experimental data on a related system. The most promising inhibitors with drug-like properties were molecules targeting the Glu66 to Arg72 region of the Kis antitoxin, as four out of five inhibitors were classified as active compounds.

2168,Enabling Five-Degree-of-Freedom From Low-Dimensional Light Fields With Extended Light Ray Acquisition Field-of-View,H. Jung; H. -J. Lee; C. E. Rhee,2023,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,0,"Conventional captured-image-based virtual reality (VR) systems hardly support free movement of the viewpoint, greatly reducing the user’s sense of reality. A light field (LF), which generates a novel view at a free viewpoint through a combination of light rays, is a suitable approach for increasing the degree of freedom (DoF) in captured-image-based VR. Previous LF-based VR systems have increased LF dimensions or used various acquisition layouts to obtain as many light rays as possible and thereby expand the renderable view range. However, these attempts are costly and time-consuming. This paper enables 5-DoF outcomes from a low-dimensional LF by increasing the field-of-view during light ray acquisition. The method starts with the simple idea that if a three-dimensional (3D) LF is constructed with 360° images that can capture all directions, the renderable range can be widened in a cost-efficient manner. However, using light rays with a large incident angle in a 3D LF can cause visual artifacts. To cope with this problem, this paper initially defines and analyzes the visual artifacts. While these errors were simply ignored in the past, they become particularly noticeable when using light rays with large incident angles. Thus, a careful analysis of the errors and their impacts is required. Additionally, this paper proposes two schemes to deal with visual artifacts based on the error analysis: a horizontal LF and vertical depth (HLF-VD) view generation scheme that complements the structural limitation of 3D LFs and can address all types of errors, and a hybrid 3D LF connection scheme that effectively reduces connection errors by controlling the connection position of neighboring 3D LFs.

Li,2024,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,IEEE Journals,0,"Cascaded H-bridge-based solid-state transformer (CHB-SST) has been the typical scheme in medium- and low-voltage ac/dc conversion applications, and large-size capacitance caused by second-order ripple of submodules (SMs) is the inherent problem of CHB-based systems. In this article, we propose a novel low-capacitance CHB-SST based on zero-impedance resonant push–pull (ZRPP) decoupling channel for ripple power. ZRPP presents zero-impedance characteristic at its switching frequency equaling to series resonant frequency, which makes the equivalent parallel of CHB ac-link capacitors, and provides a decoupling channel for ripple power. Therefore, the horizontal SMs ripple power can achieve mutual cancelation based on their own three-phase symmetry, which significantly reduces the size of ac-link capacitance. In addition, the elimination of SMs ripple-voltage achieves the elimination of grid zero-sequence harmonics from root cause, and the mutual clamping of parallel ac-link capacitors also achieves the voltages self-balancing, which reduces the complex of system control. The CHB-SST configuration, operating principle, ripple-power decoupling, SMs voltage self-balancing, system design, and evaluation are discussed in this article. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CHB-SST is verified by simulation and experiment.",Cascaded H-bridge (CHB);low-capacitance;resonant push–pull;solid-state transformer (SST);voltage balancing;zero-sequence harmonics,,"School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"

Achieved through precise control of the electric field distribution, a good coplanarity can lower the reliability risks, for example, interfacial voiding or interlayer mismatch, to improve the product yield. However, with developments of greater wafer size and finer interconnect structure, higher demands are set on the material properties. Nanotwinned copper (nt-Cu) is of high-density and highly (111)-oriented coherent twin boundaries and exhibiting enhanced mechanical and electrical performances. In the present study, nt-Cu based electroplating for 8-inch RDL patterned wafer in wafer level packaging (WLP) is conducted with a proprietary plating bath on a horizontal electroplating system. Equipment setting/parameter effects such as shielding plates, circulating flow rate, and wafer spin rate are analyzed on coplanarity performance of nt-Cu. The results indicate nt-Cu microstructure can be formed throughout the wafer and the coplanarity indexed by within-die (WID) nonuniformity is manipulated below the technical threshold < 8%, which is repeatable in an 8 out of 30 random checks.

Schmalholz,2019,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"Numerous processes such as metamorphic reactions, fluid and melt transfer and earthquakes occur at a subducting zone, but are still incompletely understood. These processes are affected, or even controlled, by the magnitude and distribution of stress and deformation mechanism. To eventually understand subduction zone processes, we quantify here stresses and deformation mechanisms in and around a subducting lithosphere, surrounded by asthenosphere and overlain by an overriding plate. We use 2-D thermomechanical numerical simulations based on the finite difference and marker-in-cell method and consider a 3200 km wide and 660 km deep numerical domain with a resolution of 1 km by 1 km. We apply a combined visco-elasto-plastic deformation behaviour using a linear combination of diffusion creep, dislocation creep and Peierls creep for the viscous deformation. We consider two end-member subduction scenarios: forced and free subduction. In the forced scenario, horizontal velocities are applied to the lateral boundaries of the plates during the entire simulation. In the free scenario, we set the horizontal boundary velocities to zero once the subducted slab is long enough to generate a slab pull force large enough to maintain subduction without horizontal boundary velocities. A slab pull of at least 1.8 TN m–1 is required to continue subduction in the free scenario. We also quantify along-profile variations of gravitational potential energy (GPE). We evaluate the contributions of topography and density variations to GPE variations across a subduction system. The GPE variations indicate large-scale horizontal compressive forces around the trench region and extension forces on both sides of the trench region. Corresponding vertically averaged differential stresses are between 120 and 170 MPa. Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the dominant deformation mechanisms. Elastoplastic deformation is the dominant mechanism in the upper region of the lithosphere and subducting slab (from ca. 5 to 60 km depth from the top of the slab). Viscous deformation dominates in the lower region of the lithosphere and in the asthenosphere. Considering elasticity in the calculations has an important impact on the magnitude and distribution of deviatoric stress; hence, simulations with increased shear modulus, in order to reduce elasticity, exhibit considerably different stress fields. Limiting absolute stress magnitudes by decreasing the internal friction angle causes slab detachment so that slab pull cannot be transmitted anymore to the horizontal lithosphere. Applying different boundary conditions shows that forced subduction simulations are stronger affected by the applied boundary conditions than free subduction simulations. We also compare our modelled topography and gravity anomaly with natural data of seafloor bathymetry and free-air gravity anomalies across the Mariana trench. Elasticity and deviatoric stress magnitudes of several hundreds of MPa are required to best fit the natural data. This agreement suggests that the modelled flexural behaviour and density field are compatible with natural data. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of our results to the depth of faulting in a subducting plate and to the generation of petit-spot volcanoes.",Numerical modelling;Dynamics: gravity and tectonics;Lithospheric flexure;Rheology: mantle;Subduction zone processes,,"Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; annelore.bessat@unil.ch; Univ Rennes, CNRS, Géosciences Rennes – UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland"

Barbosa,2021,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"We present a method for inverting total-field anomaly data to estimate the geometry of a uniformly magnetized 3-D geological source in the subsurface. The method assumes the total-magnetization direction is known. We approximate the source by an ensemble of vertically juxtaposed right prisms, all of them with the same total-magnetization vector and depth extent. The horizontal cross-section of each prism is a polygon defined by a given number of equi-angularly spaced vertices from 0° to 360°, whose polygon vertices are described by polar coordinates with an origin defined by a horizontal location over the top of each prism. Because our method estimates the radii of each polygon vertex we refer to it as radial inversion. The position of these vertices, the horizontal location of each prism and the depth extent of all prisms are the parameters to be estimated by solving a constrained non-linear inverse problem of minimizing a goal function. We run successive inversions for a range of tentative total-magnetization intensities and depths to the top of the shallowest prism. The estimated models producing the lowest values of the goal function form the set of candidate solutions. To obtain stabilized solutions, we impose the zeroth- and first-order Tikhonov regularizations on the shape of the prisms. The method allows estimating the geometry of both vertical and inclined sources, with a constant direction of magnetization, by using the Tikhonov regularization. Tests with synthetic data show that the method can be of utility in estimating the shape of the magnetic source even in the presence of a strong regional field. Results obtained by inverting airborne total-field anomaly data over the Anitápolis alkaline–carbonatitic complex, in southern Brazil, suggest that the emplacement of the magnetic sources was controlled by NW–SE-trending faults at depth, in accordance with known structural features at the study area.",Magnetic anomalies: modelling and interpretion;Inverse theory;Numerical solutions,,"Observatório Nacional, Gal.

Amin,2019,2019 14th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems (ICCES),IEEE Conferences,0,"Rehabilitation is a vital process for adult people after injury to regain their quality of life. This paper proposes a mobile-based system for upper limb rehabilitation to overcome a lack of motivation that occurs in the conventional one. Recent studies found that poor adherence to physiotherapy sessions refers to many reasons, one of them is the lack of motivation. Accordingly, conducting therapeutic sessions in the form of serious games will surely motivate patients more, hence helping them to improve their quality of life. In this work, therefore, we propose two serious mobile games to facilitate post-injures rehabilitation, which utilize smartphone's accelerometer sensor to control the game. Since the proposed system depends on User Centered Design (UCD) approach, two prototypes were tested. The First Prototype targets elbow and shoulder joints. To cover these mentioned joints' exercises, the game is developed into three levels: first-level targets elbow extension. The second one includes two sub-levels; first one targets wrist supination/pronation, second sub-level combines both wrist supination and elbow extension. In the third level, the patient must perform wrist supination/pronation, and elbow flexion/extension. Second prototype includes three different games which target wrist supination/pronation, forearm supination/pronation, shoulder flexion, shoulder horizontal adduction/abduction, and elbow flexion/extension. As a pilot evaluation many visits to a rehabilitation center were arranged, the therapist confirmed that the game covers those mentioned exercises and selected three convenient recruited cases to play the game and check its usability. They stated that the system covers some conventional exercises they perform; they provided feedback that helped in system enhancement prior to final evaluation.

2175,An Adaptive UAV Deployment Scheme for Emergency Networking,N. Lin; Y. Liu; L. Zhao; D. O. Wu; Y. Wang,2022,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,IEEE Journals,25,"In the areas after natural disaster strikes, the ground communication network can be failed, due to the damage of the communication infrastructure. However, during or after the natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis, ground vehicles may not enter the affected areas easily to set up mobile base stations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an alternate to provide emergency coverage for ground nodes (GNs). Therefore, how to determine the best location for UAV to achieve the maximum coverage is a key issue. In this paper, an adaptive UAV deployment scheme is proposed to solve the coverage problem of UAV- aided GNs communication. The objective is to optimize the location of the UAV to cover as many GNs as possible and reduce communication energy consumption. We construct a unique analysis method assisted by the collected ground information to solve this problem. First, we propose an information collection method based on the communication probability of Line-of-Sight (LoS) to guarantee the integrity of ground information acquisition. Then, based on the results of the information collection, a virtual obstacle model is built around each GN. Meanwhile, the UAV’s coverage problem is decomposed from the horizontal and vertical dimensions to simplify the difficulty of solving the problem. Finally, the best location of the UAV and the optimal transmission power of GNs can be obtained through the iterative methods and the power control, respectively.

Ma,2022,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,IEEE Journals,14,"The existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based electric transmission line inspection systems generally adopt manual control and follow the predefined path, which reduces the efficiency and makes a high inspection cost. In this article, a UAV system with advanced embedded processors and binocular visual sensors is developed to generate guidance information from power lines in real-time and achieve automatic transmission line inspection. To realize 3-D autonomous perception of power lines, we first propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract complementary information from multilevel features and detect power lines with different pixel widths and orientations. Specifically, multilevel feature aggregation module fuses multilevel features within the same stage by learning the weight vector related to the content. The joint attention (JA) module is proposed to extract rich semantic information and suppress the background noises. Meanwhile, multistage detection results are fused to enhance the robustness of the proposed network. Subsequently, power lines are grouped according to the morphological characteristics of thinning detection results, and 3-D point sets of power lines are constructed based on the epipolar constraint of binocular images. Finally, the target point of current stereo images is generated by projecting 3-D power line points to the horizontal and vertical planes. The few-waypoint trajectory is generated based on continuous target points, and automatic inspection is finished with the proposed real-time motion planning strategy.

This directly translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency. The calculations we have based on industry standard equipment from several manufacturers show that this is not just a concept but a feasible system which can be implemented.The proposed system can play a supportive role with existing autonomous vehicle architecture and it is easily applicable in an urban area.",,,"Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland; Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland; Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"

Haptic feedback becomes essential when visual feedback is compromised, either due to visual occlusions or poor depth perception. However, haptic interfaces, are often bulky because they require heavy actuators to provide force feedback. The bulkiness reduces user mobility and makes these interfaces unsuitable for prolonged use. Here, we propose a wearable haptic sleeve that encompasses the wrist and elbow joints of a human arm. The two joint rotations control the motion of a drone in a simulated environment along a horizontal plane. The sleeve is composed of modular electroadhesive clutches that block the joint movement when the drone is in the vicinity of an obstacle. The clutches are lightweight ($27 \,\mathrm{g}$), require low power ($\sim$ $1 \,\mathrm{m}\mathrm{W}$) to operate, and can be mounted on the user without affecting the user’s mobility. A motor learning subject study is conducted to navigate a drone through a hole in a wall where the depth perception of visual feedback is compromised. The results of the study show that subjects trained with the wearable haptic sleeve learnt the drone obstacle avoidance task and retained the necessary motor skills after haptic training, compared to subjects who received only visual feedback and were unable to learn the motor task.",Drone teleoperation;human-robot interfaces;textile devices;wearable haptics,,"Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"

Arleo,2020,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,IEEE Journals,21,"We embed a spiking cerebellar model within an adaptive real-time (RT) control loop that is able to operate a real robotic body (iCub) when performing different vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) tasks. The spiking neural network computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural activity, and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, leads to a nondeterministic computation time caused by the neural activity volleys encountered during cerebellar simulation. This nondeterministic computation time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that is able to ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation. Actually, our neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the biological sensory motor delay between the cerebellum and the body to buffer the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility in adjusting the neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the cerebellar simulation by either halting the simulation or disabling certain neural computation features (i.e., STDP mechanisms, spike propagation, and neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the real robot operation. This neurorobotic experimental setup is applied to different horizontal and vertical VOR adaptive tasks that are widely used by the neuroscientific community to address cerebellar functioning. We aim to elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar neural substrate and the distributed plasticity shapes the cerebellar neural activity to mediate motor adaptation. This paper underlies the need for a two-stage learning process to facilitate VOR acquisition.",Cerebellar adaptation;neurorobotics;real-time (RT) control;spiking neural network;vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR),,"Department of Computer Architecture and Technology, Research Centre for Information and Communication Technologies, University of Granada, Granada, Spain; Department of Computer Architecture and Technology, Research Centre for Information and Communication Technologies, University of Granada, Granada, Spain; Department of Computer Architecture and Technology, Research Centre for Information and Communication Technologies, University of Granada, Granada, Spain; INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"
2186,Integration and Performance Study of Full Functional Sea Farm Inspection Platform for Aquaculture Application,O. L. Osen; S. O. Liavåg; L. E. Sætre; O. Morken; H. Zhang,2019,OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE,IEEE Conferences,5,"This paper describes the incremental development of a concept called Sea Farm Inspection Platform. The purpose of the project is twofold. Firstly, it is a very relevant and good project for students. Secondly, there are significant opportunities for such innovations in the aquaculture industry. The Sea Farm Inspection Platform consists of essentially a lowcost USV (semi-submersible design) that carries a low-cost ROV that can be used to inspect aquafarm installations. The operation principle is that the USV can be navigated to the desired location by the use of thrusters, either operated manually or through the built-in autopilot. When the desired location is reached the ROV can be deployed and lowered into the water column by using the on-board launch and recovery system which consists of a winch and a docking mechanism. The ROV has a camera and environmental sensors and has thrusters that allow it to change heading (yaw) and position in the horizontal plane (surge and sway), the vertical position (heave) is controlled by the winch. Hence, the ROV has negative buoyancy and is hanging below the USV as a pendulum. Structural integrity of fish farms is paramount. This applies to structures, nets and moorings. The installations are expensive by them self and the nets contain fish of significant value. Escaped fish can cause great financial loss to the owners and severe damage to the environment. Further, it is important to monitor the health and the ability for the fish to utilise the fodder. Aqua farms are subject to diseases from pathogens and algae blooms can kill all the fish in an installation in a very short time. Hence, thorough inspection and monitoring of the facilities is extremely important. This innovation is a step down the path towards more automation in the aquaculture industry and will hopefully inspire developments of similar products. The project is now in its 3rd year. There have been a series incremental developments as more or less new teams of students have been working on the project every semester. From a pedagogical point of view, this project has served as a good example of Project-Based Learning. In the following sections, we will describe some of the recent changes in the design and the integration process. One section will also give more background on the pedagogical aspects of the project and how well it complies with the concept of Project-Based Learning and Constructive Alignment.",ROV;Concept design;dynamic position control;marine aquaculture applications;semi-submersible;project-based learning;constructive alignment,,"Department of ICT and Natural Sciences (IIR), Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Postboks 1517, Aalesund, Norway; Department of ICT and Natural Sciences (IIR), Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Postboks 1517, Aalesund, Norway; Department of ICT and Natural Sciences (IIR), Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Postboks 1517, Aalesund, Norway; Department of ICT and Natural Sciences (IIR), Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Postboks 1517, Aalesund, Norway; Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering (IHB), Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Postboks 1517, Aalesund, Norway"

However, most of the existing inspection drones are for transmission line inspection in the open field environment, with the characteristics of large size and high quality, which is difficult to be directly applied to transmission line inspection around the city area. To address the above issues, in this paper, a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection system is designed with the aim of achieving autonomous inspection of overhead ground wires in urban peripheral areas, combined with image processing technology, with a total weight of less than 400g. Specifically, during the inspection of small UAV, Raspberry Pi uses traditional image processing methods such as Hough transform to obtain the position information and pixel error of ground wire from real time video stream; the flight control system uses the results of image processing combined with data from millimetre wave radar to achieve conversion from pixel error to actual distance error; finally, the ground wire is made to be in the center of the video as much as possible through the correction strategy, thus realizing the autonomous inspection task of the small UAV along the line. The experimental results show that the small UAV can stably identify the target transmission lines and achieve autonomous flight along the lines with horizontal deviation within plus or minus 0.3 m and height deviation within plus or minus 0.1 m, which is of great reference value for the application of small UAV in urban transmission line inspection.",Small UAV;image processing;error conversion;autonomous correction system;control system,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"

In contrast to finding the shortest path for every single IAV that may not guarantee overall transportation efficiency, this paper considers a large of container-transportation tasks and proposes a novel path planning algorithm for all the scheduled IAVs based on dynamic traffic flow assignment. We first establish a traffic flow model to describe flow evolution in transportation areas including quay and stack sides in container terminals. Then the minimization of total transportation time is considered as the objective function and path planning for all the scheduled IAVs is designed in the model predictive control (MPC) framework. The routes are obtained by establishing the receding-horizon optimization based on predicted traffic states and solving by a resilient back-propagation solution algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can mitigate congestion in transportation areas by redirecting the IAV flow distribution, improve the overall transportation efficiency and effectively handle the system uncertainties and disturbances, i.e., inaccurate information of operation tasks, facilities failure and breakdown.",path planning;intelligent autonomous vehicles;dynamic traffic flow assignment;model predictive control,,"College of Transport and Communications, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China; College of Transport and Communications, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"

Here, we suggest a way to manipulate the number of BICs in the spectra by controlling the layers and the shape or arrangement of the rectangular nanoholes in each layer of the metasurface, illuminated by a p-polarized plane wave. It is convenient to achieve symmetry protected multiple at-Γ BICs and multiple off-Γ BICs associated with the decoupling of the radiation waves and improve their regulation depth only by adjusting the layers and one single nanohole arrangement and shape in one lattice in each layer, without introducing extra geometric complexity of the metasurface. Additionally, we demonstrate the multiple BICs are robust and have a good tolerance to fabrication imperfections.

Expressions for the b-th moment of the conditional success probability for both the entire network and each tier are derived, based on which the exact meta distributions and the beta approximations are evaluated and compared. Key performance metrics, including the mean success probability, the variance of the conditional success probability, the mean local delay, and the asymptotic SIR gains of each tier are obtained. The results show that the biases are detrimental to the overall mean success probability of the whole network and that the b-th moment curve of the conditional success probability of each tier can be tightly approximated by the horizontal shifted versions of the first moment curve of the single-tier PPP network.

This article presents an approach for the design of VHF aircraft-integrated antenna arrays with switchable beams by using the characteristic modes (CMs) of the aircraft platform. The CMs of the aircraft platform provide the modal significances, modal currents, and modal radiation fields of each mode. An in-depth investigation over the useful CMs information is performed to prove the feasibility of design VHF band antenna array using the CMs of the platform. Switchable radiation patterns with horizontal polarization are then synthesized from these CMs. The switchable beams and polarization constraint make it more challenging than CM-based fixed power pattern synthesis. The polarized switchable beam synthesis is carried out with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. A trade-off among the synthesized current distributions for different beam steering angles is made to determine the optimal current excitation locations for antenna array development. Meanwhile, a novel bandwidth enhanced triple-couple-line coupling element is proposed to allow aircraft platform flush-mounted designs.

Then, the Cosine Symmetry Method is proposed by the variable polarization observation of coherent accumulation, which replaces the Least Square Method to estimate the target scattering matrix. Subsequently, the Generalized Squint Projection Transformation is proposed to realize the coherent accumulation of target signals under the variable polarization interference, which can effectively resolve the problem of amplitude loss and noise influence in coherent accumulation.

Shen,2023,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,IEEE Journals,0,"In multimodal data fusion and land-cover interpretation tasks, the fusion interpretability between hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is always nontrivial to be clarified. Furthermore, the heterogeneous sample and distribution variances of these two remote sensing (RS) modalities impede the joint classification performance. In this article, a hyperspectral intrinsic image decomposition guided data fusion network (HI $^{2}\text{D}^{2}$ FNet) is proposed. Generally, classic hyperspectral intrinsic image decomposition (HIID) performs well in image enhancement and shadow removal. It decomposes one HSI into one reflectance component and one shading component. Inspired by the core mechanism of HIID, our motivation is to preliminarily exploit its potential for multimodal RS data fusion and explore the inherent modality connection between HSI and LiDAR data from the intrinsic perspective. Specifically, compared with existing techniques, HI $^{2}\text{D}^{2}$ FNet is capable of fusing the horizontal geometry information in the shading component with the vertical geometry information in the LiDAR data from both sample and distribution perspectives in the spatial domain. The generated cross-modal geometry feature contributes to guiding the reflectance stream optimization. This unique fusion framework connects both the modalities with respect to geometry information and enhances the specific fusion interpretability. The decomposition and fusion modules in HI $^{2}\text{D}^{2}$ FNet are optimized simultaneously in a novel alternative optimization pattern. Furthermore, several unique cross-modal constraints in terms of prior RS properties are presented. Experiments conducted on three widely available datasets prove the superiority of HI $^{2}\text{D}^{2}$ FNet over state-of-the-art techniques.

Akram,2023,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,IEEE Early Access Articles,0,"For oil-immersed power equipment, the accumulation of cellulose impurities in oil-paper insulation poses a significant problem. To address this issue, this study investigates the migration and bridging characteristics of cellulose impurities in oil-paper insulation under DC voltage. A kinetic analysis model is developed to simulate the impurity trajectories and quantitative analysis of speed, offset distance, and other parameters of cellulose impurities. The results indicate the motion cycle of cellulose impurity under the slightly uneven DC electric field consists of lifting, upward, and downward stages, with a maximum speed of over 102 mm/s and maximum acceleration of over 102 m/s2. During the lifting stage, particle velocity grows quickly and then slows, while during the downward stage velocity increases sharply to a maximum and then gradually decreases. The horizontal offset distance decreases with increased motion cycles. The cellulose impurities departed from the sphere electrode and the insulating paper surface migrate in opposite directions along their respective trajectories. As they gradually approach each other, these impurities undergo collisions and exchange charges, and eventually form a heap-like bridge. Results of this study can guide the development of better insulation materials for high-voltage electrical equipment and aid in the removal of impurities.",Oil-paper insulation;cellulose impurity;migration movement;bridging;finite element method;kinetic model,,"College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; College of Electrical Engineering and Control Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China"

2209,Detection of Driver Cognitive Distraction Using Machine Learning Methods,A. Misra; S. Samuel; S. Cao; K. Shariatmadari,2023,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,2,"Driver distraction is one of the primary causes of crashes. As a result, there is a great need to continuously observe driver state and provide appropriate interventions to distracted drivers. Cognitive distraction refers to the “look but not see” situations when the drivers’ eyes are focused on the forward roadway, but their mind is not. Typically, cognitive distractions can result from fatigue, conversation with a co-passenger, listening to the radio, or other similarly loading secondary tasks that do not necessarily take a driver’s eyes off the roadway. This makes it one of the hardest distractions to detect as there are no visible clues of driver distraction. In this study, we have identified features from different sources including eye-tracking, physiological, and vehicle kinematics data that are relevant towards the classification of distracted and non-distracted drivers via the analysis of data collected from a driving simulator study involving 40 drivers across multiple driving scenarios. The key classification algorithms implemented include Random Forest, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. A reduced feature set including pupil area, pupil vertical and horizontal motion was found to be predictive of driver distraction while maintaining an average accuracy of 90% across various road types. Additionally, the impact of road types on driver behaviour was also identified.

The current mainstream detection methods have high accuracy in this task, but the number of model parameters is large, and the detection speed is slow. Based on YOLOv5s as the basic framework, this paper proposes YOLOv5S-A2, which can improve the detection speed and reduce the model size at the cost of reducing the detection accuracy. Firstly, a data augmentation strategy is proposed by combining various operations to alleviate the problem of unbalanced class instances. Secondly, we proposed a path aggregation module for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to make new horizontal connections. It can enhance multi-scale feature representation capability and compensate for the loss of feature information. Thirdly, an attention detection head module is proposed to solve the aliasing effect in cross-scale fusion and enhance the representation of predictive features.

Our method achieves 87.3% mean average precision (mAP), surpassing the original model’s 7.9%, and the frames per second (FPS) value is maintained at 87.7. To show generality, we tested it on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) without tuning and obtained an average precision of 94.1%, and the FPS value is maintained at about 105.3.

In the process of fatigued driving detection, the evaluation based on a single sign is biased. To improve the adaptability and accuracy of fatigued driving detection, this paper proposes an improved D-S evidence theory-based algorithm for detecting facial fatigue signs. This algorithm uses the multi-thread-optimized Dlib to track and locate the image of the face, captures the 68 key points of the driver’s face with reference to the Dlib open-source library, and narrows the target areas to the eyes and mouth regions. Based on the video stream, it calculates the horizontal and vertical ratios of the eyes and mouth to determine the fatigue sign subsets based on the EAR and MAR within a unit cycle, and calculates the Pitch angle after converting the head pose from 2D images to 3D models, which is used for determining the status of the head pose. The algorithm then fuses multiple feature subsets and uses the improved D-S evidence theory to optimize the weights of the three subsets to mitigate the influence of the “general conflict” and “one veto” problems, and to increase the temporal correlation coefficient of a single fatigue sign.

Bourlai,2023,"IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science",IEEE Journals,0,"Geometric normalization is an integral part of most of the face recognition (FR) systems. To geometrically normalize a face, it is essential to detect the eye centers, since one way to align the face images is to make the line joining the eye centers horizontal. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect eye centers in the challenging Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum (8- $14 ~\mu \text{m}$ ). While using thermal band images for face recognition is a feasible approach in low-light and nighttime conditions, where visible face images cannot be used, there are not many thermal or dual band (visible and thermal) face datasets available to train and test new eye center detection models. This work takes advantage of the available deep learning based eye center detection algorithms in the visible band to detect the eye centers in thermal face images through image synthesis. While we empirically evaluate different image synthesis models, we determine that StarGAN2 yields the highest eye center detection accuracy, when compared to the other state-of-the-art models. We incorporate alignment loss that captures the normalized error between the detected and actual eye centers as an additional loss term during training (using the generated images during training, ground truth annotations, and an eye center detection model), so that the model learns to align the images to minimize this error. During test phase, visible images are generated from the thermal images using the trained model. Then, the available landmark detection algorithms in the visible band, namely, MT-CNN and HR-Net are used to detect the eye centers. Next, these eye centers are used to geometrically normalize the source thermal face images before performing same-spectral (thermal-to-thermal) face recognition. The proposed method improved the eye center detection accuracy by 60% over the baseline model, and by 14% over training only the StarGAN2 model without the alignment loss. The proposed approach also reports the highest improvement in the face recognition accuracy by 36% and 3% over the baseline and original StarGAN2 models, respectively, when using deep learning based face recognition models, namely, Facenet, ArcFace, and VGG-Face. We also perform experiments by augmenting the train and test datasets with images rotated in-plane to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. When CycleGAN (another unpaired image translation network) is used to generate images before incorporating the alignment loss, it failed to preserve the alignment at the slightest, therefore the eye center detection accuracy was extremely low. With the alignment loss, the accuracy increased by 20%, 50%, and 80% when the normalized error (e)  $\le0.05$ , 0.10 and 0.25 respectively.",Biometrics;face recognition;thermal imaging;long wave infrared;geometric normalization;image synthesis;alignment loss;eye center detection;StarGAN2;MT-CNN;HR-Net,,"Multi-Spectral Imagery Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA; Multi-Spectral Imagery Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"

In this paper, an effective spatial framework for mmWave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with VPSs is proposed by utilizing stochastic geometry approaches. Base stations (BSs) are modeled by a Poisson point process and vehicles are distributed according to multiple type II Matérn hard-core processes. To characterize the blockage process caused by vehicles, a closed-form expression is deduced to distinguish line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS transmission. This expression demonstrates that LOS links are independent of horizontal communication distances. Several closed-form probability density functions of the communication distance between a reference platoon and its serving transmitter (other platoons or BSs) are derived for analyzing the generated path loss. After designing three practical user association techniques, tractable expressions for coverage probabilities are figured out. Our work theoretically shows that the maximum density of VPSs exists and large antenna scales benefit the networks' coverage performance.

We propose a greedy algorithm, named DBSH-IBFD, to solve three sub-problems as follows: 1) All DBSs are deployed one by one. The horizontal location of a DBS is determined by the area with the maximum aggregated weight (the weight is defined by the number, the location, and SINR of a UE) and then the altitude of a DBS is determined by which the maximum network throughput is achieved. 2) Each UE is associated with the BS that provides the best signal-to-noise-ratio. 3) The power and bandwidth of the MBS are allocated to all DBSs based on the workload, and all BSs allocate power and bandwidth to their associated UEs.

We propose a method to provide safety guarantees when using a neural network collision avoidance system. The neural network outputs are bounded using neural network verification tools like Reluplex and Reluval, and a reachability method determines all possible ways aircraft encounters will resolve using neural network advisories and assuming bounded aircraft dynamics. Experiments with systems inspired by ACAS X show that neural networks giving either horizontal or vertical maneuvers can be proven safe. We explore how relaxing the bounds on aircraft dynamics can lead to potentially unsafe encounters and demonstrate how neural network controllers can be modified to guarantee safety through online costs or lowering alerting cost. The reachability method is flexible and can incorporate uncertainties such as pilot delay and sensor error. These results suggest a method for certifying neural network collision avoidance systems for use in real aircraft.",,,"Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"

Lungalage,2020,"2020 IEEE 4th International Conference on Image Processing, Applications and Systems (IPAS)",IEEE Conferences,15,"Coconut production is the most important and one of the main sources of income in the Sri Lankan economy. The recent time it has been observed that most of the coconut trees are affected by the diseases which gradually reduces the strength and production of coconut. Most of the tree leaves are affected by pest diseases and nutrient deficiency. Our main intensive is to enhance the livelihood of coconut leaves and identify the diseases at the early stage so that farmers get more benefits from coconut production. This paper proposes the detection of pest attack and nutrient deficiency in the coconut leaves and analysis of the diseases. Coconut leaves monitorization has been taken place after the use of pesticides and fertilizer with the help of the finest machine learning and image processing techniques. Rather than human experts, automatic recognition will be beneficial and the fastest approach to identify the diseases in the coconut leaves very efficiently. Thus, in this project, we developed an android mobile application to identify the pests by their food behaviors, pest diseases and the nutrition deficiencies in the coconut trees. As an initial step, all datasets for image processing technology met pre-processing steps such as converting RGB to greyscale, filtering, resizing, horizontal flip and vertical flip. After completing the above steps, the classification was performed by analyzing several algorithms in the literature review. SVM and CNN were chosen as the best and appropriate classifier with 93.54% and 93.72% of accuracy respectively.

This unique capability of their tongue represents a promising design for a tool for picking up and handling objects in unstructured environments. Although continuum robots can produce dexterous movements because of their few shape constraints, the lack of structural stiffness has restricted their deployment in real-world environments. Inspired by the characteristics of woodpeckers, we designed a robot manipulator that can substantially extend its length and bend its shape in 2D space. This behavior is enabled by a backbone consisting of a chain of rigid joints and two flexible rack gears. The joints increase the payload by structurally supporting the robot. The proposed structure is 4.7 times stronger in vertical bending and 6.2 times stronger in torsion than without rigid links. Feeding the rack gears at the same and different speeds allows the robot to elongate and bend, respectively. We developed a geometric model based on a constant curvature model for motion planning.

This manipulator can demonstrate outstanding torsional stiffness since the circumferential rotation between the vertebrae is constrained by four ball pins. The point contact between ball pins and guideways effectively reduces the friction between the vertebrae, thus allowing the designed manipulator to yield a smooth bending shape with constant curvature. This manipulator features high axial and torsional stiffness, excellent bending performance, sufficient loading capacity, and convenient integration with surgical instruments. Moreover, the excellent torsional stiffness enables this manipulator to efficiently transfer torque and be applied in in-situ torsional motion, effectively addressing the typical issue of limited dexterity for torsional motion. The kinematic modeling of the proposed manipulator under in-situ torsional motion has been derived, and its workspace has been analyzed. A robotic system has been assembled, and experiments have verified the proposed design and modeling validity. The results show that the maximum position errors in bending motion are 2.39% (horizontal direction) and 1.98% (vertical direction), and its torsional stiffness is 21.13N $\cdot $ mm/deg, which is 46 times higher than that of a typical spherical flexible manipulator (SFM).

Yue,2020,2020 5th International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM),IEEE Conferences,1,"Inspired by insects' visual brains, this paper presents original modelling of a complementary visual neuronal systems model for real-time and robust collision sensing. Two categories of wide-field motion sensitive neurons, i.e., the lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locusts and the lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) in flies, have been studied, intensively. The LGMDs have specific selectivity to approaching objects in depth that threaten collision; whilst the LPTCs are only sensitive to translating objects in horizontal and vertical directions. Though each has been modelled and applied in various visual scenes including robot scenarios, little has been done on investigating their complementary functionality and selectivity when functioning together. To fill this vacancy, we introduce a hybrid model combining two LGMDs (LGMD-1 and LGMD-2) with horizontally (rightward and leftward) sensitive LPTCs (LPTC-R and LPTC-L) specialising in fast collision perception. With coordination and competition between different activated neurons, the proximity feature by frontal approaching stimuli can be largely sharpened up by suppressing translating and receding motions.

Tondu,2021,2020 IEEE-RAS 20th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids),IEEE Conferences,0,"The atlatl, or spear-thrower, is a primitive weapon, which is generally understood as a simple wrist lever. We propose to renew this interpretation by a simple kinematic analysis of the serial chain constituted by the arm, the forearm, the hand holding the atlatl and the dart, moving in a vertical plane. While the release velocity of a hand-delivered spear towards the target is made difficult due to the limited-joint range in wrist radial/ulnar deviation, the atlatl’s passive hook makes possible to overcome this difficulty. The atlatl can therefore be seen as a clever cyborg device, understood as a substitute of the hand with a special ability to orient the dart to be thrown. In a kinematic point of view, it realizes a shifting of the optimal throwing configuration from the upper-limb fully extended in a vertical position, badly adapted to human shoulder and wrist, to a much more efficient horizontal position. As a consequence, a summation of shoulder, elbow and wrist speeds results, leading to dart release velocities much greater than these got with a hand-delivered spear, while throw accuracy is kept. Because the atlatl’s learning is based on our natural ability to throw by comparison, for example, with the bow technology, and because its use is based more on gesture quality than on purely muscular power, the atlatl is according to us a remarkable historical example both of easy-to-learn and non-gendered cyborg device.",,,"LAAS/CNRS, Université Fédérale de Toulouse, France"

An online Flux Mapping System (FMS) is needed to monitor the core during the reactor operation. FMS estimates the core flux distribution from the measurements of few in-core detectors using an appropriate algorithm. Here, a Distributed Artificial Neural Network (D-ANN) model is developed using parallel-forward multi-layer perceptron architecture to capture the spatial core flux variation in a nuclear reactor. The proposed D-ANN model is tested with simulated test case data of Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) for multiple operating conditions of the reactor. The model estimates the neutron flux in all horizontal mesh locations (2-D) from the multiple networks distributed spatially across AHWR core. Estimation error using the proposed D-ANN model is found to be significantly lower than that with lumped ANN model. Validation exercises establish that this D-ANN model could effectively capture the spatial variations in the reactor core and therefore could be utilized for efficient flux mapping.

The float solution of angular misalignment and reference position of the transponder are estimated based on Kronecker product. Then the float Euler angles parameterization is fixed using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To verify the performance of the improved adjustment method, a field test was conducted in the South China Sea.

Together with the relative position measurements between agents, the acceleration measurements on the plane of the rotors of at least one of the agents are also used in the observation process. For evaluation of the proposed method, an algorithm-in-loop 6DOF simulation environment is developed. The results illustrate that the growth rate of navigation errors is significantly reduced; 97% in the horizontal plane and 40% in the vertical one.

Leng,2022,2022 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),IEEE Conferences,0,"As a relatively new biometric modality, palmprint attracts much attention for its rich intrinsic features and high commercial prospects. Most existing palmprint recognition methods only extract features from the region of interest (ROI) and neglect the features of other regions. Hence, the recognition performance of these methods highly relies on ROI localization, and it requires users' high cooperation. To relieve these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end recognition framework for contactless whole-palm region-based recognition in this paper, dubbed as Channel Groupwise Drop Network (CGDNet). CGDNet consists of a trunk branch and a part exciting branch. The trunk branch extracts the global representations, and the global scale (GS) module is designed to measure the similarity from feature positions to obtain global knowledge. In the part exciting branch, the features are split into two fine-grained parts equally along the horizontal direction. Then, the channel group-wise drop (CGD) module is designed to aggregate the same part features of the object and cooperates with the CGD mask, which randomly drops the same region in the channel group to excite diverse fine-grained features for learning. Finally, fine-grained features and the global features are concatenated as the final feature.

In predicting river water levels and discharge time series, one of the most common sources of error with AI forecasting algorithms is the input imitation defect. When the input imitation defect occurs, regression methods simply present the input variables as output. In this paper, the input imitation defect is minimized by first introducing the two concepts of vertical error and horizontal error. Subsequently, upstream imagery information is combined with previous lags to propose a new procedure for predicting future satellite signals accurately and with the lowest possible input imitation defect. To accomplish this, the brightness temperature received by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer is used as a proxy of river discharge.

This is particularly true in the elastic regime: The cycle-skipping phenomenon is more severe in elastic FWI compared to acoustic FWI due to the short S-wave wavelength. In this article, we extend our work on extrapolated FWI (EFWI) by proposing to synthesize the low frequencies of multicomponent elastic seismic records and use those “artificial” low frequencies to seed the frequency sweep of elastic FWI. Our solution involves deep learning: we can either train the same convolutional neural network (CNN) on two training datasets, one with vertical components and one with horizontal components of particle velocities, or train with two components together, to extrapolate the low frequencies of elastic data for 2-D elastic FWI. The architecture of this CNN is designed with a large receptive field by dilated convolution. Numerical examples on the Marmousi2 model show that the 2–4 Hz low-frequency data extrapolated from band-limited data above 4 Hz provide good starting models for elastic FWI of P- and S-wave velocities. In addition, we study the generalization ability of the proposed neural network from acoustic to elastic data.

Smith,2022,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,IEEE Journals,1,"In this letter, we tackle the problem of planning an optimal coverage path for a robot operating indoors. Many existing approaches attempt to discourage turns in the path by covering the environment along the least number of coverage lines, i.e., straight-line paths. This is because turning not only slows down the robot but also negatively affects the quality of coverage, e.g., tools like cameras and cleaning attachments commonly have poor performance around turns. The problem of minimizing coverage lines however is typically solved using heuristics that do not guarantee optimality. In this work, we propose a turn-minimizing coverage planning method that computes the optimal number of axis-parallel (horizontal/vertical) coverage lines for the environment in polynomial time. We do this by formulating a linear program (LP) that optimally partitions the environment into axis-parallel ranks (non-intersecting rectangles of width equal to the tool width). We then generate coverage paths for a set of real-world indoor environments and compare the results with state-of-the-art coverage approaches.",Motion and path planning;optimization and optimal control;service robotics,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Avidbots Corp., Kitchener, ON, Canada; Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"

The transmitter and the relay harvest energy from the environment use it exclusively for transmitting data. In a relay on the path, a limited data buffer is used to store the received data and forward it. We consider a real-world scenario where the EH node has only local causal knowledge, i.e., at any time, each EH node only has knowledge of its own EH process, channel state, and currently received data. An EH routing algorithm based on Q learning in reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-hop CRNs (EHR-QL) is proposed. Our goal is to find an optimal routing policy that can maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Through continuous intelligent selection under the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), we use the Q learning algorithm in RL with linear function approximation to obtain the optimal path. Compared with the basic Q learning routes, the EHR-QL is superior for longer distances and higher hop counts. The algorithm produces more EH, less energy consumption, and predictable residual energy. In particular, the time complexity of the EHR-QL is analyzed and its convergence is proved. In the simulation experiments, first, we verify the EHR-QL using six EH secondary users (EH-SUs) nodes. Second, the performance (i.e., network lifetime, residual energy, and average throughput) of the EHR-QL is evaluated under the influences of different the learning rates α and discount factors γ.

In the past decade, functional fillers were usually incorporated into polymer-based composites to improve their thermal and electrical conductivity.

Here, an NG/TPU composite with a high vertical orientation structure is fabricated through a facile laminar hot pressing and wire cutting process. The NG/TPU composite exhibits anisotropic thermal conductivity with thermal conductivity of 26.79 Wm-1K-1 and 4.03 Wm-1K-1 in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively; meanwhile, due to the excellent electrical conductivity of natural graphite flakes, the high filling amount ensures that the material has excellent EMI shielding performance in the horizontal direction, up to 50.75 dB.

Lei,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,IEEE Journals,0,"Automatic and accurate classification of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is essential to assist physicians in diagnosing and grading pathological changes in pathologic myopia (PM). Clinically, due to the obvious differences in the position, shape, and size of the lesion structure in different scanning directions, ophthalmologists usually need to combine the lesion structure in the OCT images in the horizontal and vertical scanning directions to diagnose the type of pathological changes in PM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature interaction Transformer network (FIT-Net) to diagnose PM using OCT images, which consists of two dual-scale Transformer (DST) blocks and an interactive attention (IA) unit. Specifically, FIT-Net divides image features of different scales into a series of feature block sequences. In order to enrich the feature representation, we propose an IA unit to realize the interactive learning of class token in feature sequences of different scales. The interaction between feature sequences of different scales can effectively integrate different scale image features, and hence FIT-Net can focus on meaningful lesion regions to improve the PM classification performance. Finally, by fusing the dual-view image features in the horizontal and vertical scanning directions, we propose six dual-view feature fusion methods for PM diagnosis. The extensive experimental results based on the clinically obtained datasets and three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

In the traditional omnidirectional WPT system, the receiver direction is always facing the 3-D transmitter center to maximally pick up the magnetic flux. However, the on-drone receiver normally proceeds horizontal or vertical movements so that it is unable to fully utilize the magnetic flux and result in serious magnetic flux leakage. Thus, by newly proposing the 3-D intermediate coil and artfully aligning specific quadrant of double 3-D coils to the center of the flying area, the proposed WPT system can flexibly and efficiently power the drone in the specific space. Moreover, only one single power source is needed to drive the transmitter coil without using the sophisticated current phase control. Therefore, the proposed system can simultaneously achieve both quasi-omnidirectional WPT and dynamic WPT for the drone so that its flying time can be significantly extended.

Traditional railway track survey methods in combination with classical geodetic surveying apparatus such as total stations cannot meet the requirements of surveying efficiency. Accurate, reliable and fast existing railway surveying applications call for an innovative method that can obtain high-precision, continuous and uniform railway track axis position in short time without interrupting the railway traffic. This paper provides an innovative solution to track axis surveying based on the integrated technique of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS) and odometer.

Song,2019,2019 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE),IEEE Conferences,9,"Android malware has become a serious threat for our daily life, and thus there is a pressing need to effectively mitigate or defend against them. Recently, many approaches and tools to analyze Android malware have been proposed to protect legitimate users from the threat. However, most approaches focus on malware detection, while only a few of them consider malware classification or malware characterization. In this paper, we propose an extension of CDGDroid to classifying and characterizing Android malware families automatically. We first perform static analysis used in CDGDroid to extract control-flow graphs and data-flow graphs on the instruction level. Then we encode the graphs into matrices, and use them to build the family classification models via deep learning. For family characterization, we extract the n-gram sequences from the graphs, which are filtered according to the weights of the classification model built for the target family. And then we construct a vector space model and select the top-k sequences as a characterization of the target family. We have conducted some experiments to evaluate our approach and have identified that the family classification model taking the horizontal combination of CFG and DFG as features offers the best performance in terms of accuracy among all the models. Compared with CDGDroid, Drebin and many antivirus tools gathered in VirusTotal, our family classification model gives a better performance. Finally, We have also conducted experiments on family characterization, and the experimental results have shown that our characterization can capture the malicious behaviors of the testing families.","Android malware, malware family, malware characterization, static analysis, deep learning",,"College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"

Applications in the realm of volcanic hazards assessment show great promise for addressing such challenges. Here, we describe a Jupyter Notebook we developed that ingests real-time GNSS data streams from the EarthCube CHORDS (Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the geosciences) portal TZVOLCANO, applies unsupervised learning algorithms to perform automated data quality control (""noise reduction""), and explores autonomous detection of unusual volcanic activity using a neural network.

UNAVCO’s real-time data services provide near-real-time positions processed by the Trimble Pivot system. The positioning data (latitude, longitude, and height) are imported into this Jupyter Notebook in user-defined time spans. The positioning data are then collected in sets by the Jupyter Notebook and processed to extract a useful calculated variable in preparation for the machine learning algorithms, of which we choose the vector magnitude. Unsupervised K-means and Gaussian Mixture machine learning algorithms are then utilized to locate and remove data points (""filter"") that are likely caused by noise and unrelated to volcanic signals. We find that both the K-means and Gaussian Mixture machine learning algorithms perform well at identifying regions of high noise within tested GNSS data sets, but the Gaussian Mixtures approach performs better. The filtered data are then used to train an artificial intelligence neural network that predicts volcanic deformation.

On this basis, an adaptive information fusion mechanism (AIFM) based on the criteria from the degree of observability (DOO) for the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed to improve the tolerance of the integrated navigation system against time-varying observation conditions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results illustrate that the proposed observability analysis method can effectively evaluate each state variable’s observability, whose computational complexity is significantly reduced by 93.07% (the size of stripped observability matrix is  $105\times15$ ) compared with the conventional method based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Moreover, the simulation and real-world experiment results show that the AIFM makes the navigation system more robust by automatically updating the state variables’ weights according to their observability, which also enhances the reliability of the horizontal attitude angle estimation with excellent efficiency since they are given top priority in our fusion mechanism.

The safety aspect requires that the localization system does not only provide accurate information but also proper error uncertainty estimation and integrity quantification. This is challenging to be achieved for railway applications, since the environment is very complex and GNSS is typically affected by multiple local threats. In particular, multipath must be carefully modelled. In this work, we present a methodology to obtain a robust multipath error model for GNSS code observations that is adapted to each position along the railway track map. The method relies on the fact that the position of the train is constraint to the tracks and therefore the location specific impact of the environment is repeatable. The error model is therefore obtained and tested in this paper by the accumulation of data over several train runs collected with dedicated real measurement campaigns. The multipath error bounding capability is evaluated by using a modified horizontal ARAIM (H-ARAIM) adapted for the railway environment.

One of the most effective brushing method is Pones method, which combines vertical and horizontal motion of brushes during brushing.

2278,Contributions from lithospheric and upper-mantle heterogeneities to upper crustal seismicity in the Korean Peninsula,S. Lee; A. Saxena; J. -H. Song; J. Rhie; E. Choi,2021,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"The Korean Peninsula (KP), located along the eastern margin of the Eurasian and Amurian plates, has experienced continual earthquakes from small to moderate magnitudes. Various models to explain these earthquakes have been proposed, but the origins of the stress responsible for this region's seismicity remain unclear and debated. This study aims to understand the stress field of this region in terms of the contributions from crustal and upper-mantle heterogeneities imaged via seismic tomography using a series of numerical simulations. A crustal seismic velocity model can determine the crustal thickness and density. Upper-mantle seismic velocity anomalies from a regional tomography model were converted to a temperature field, which can determine the structures (e.g. lithospheric thickness, subducting slabs, their gaps, and stagnant features) and density. The heterogeneities in the crustal and upper mantle governed the buoyancy forces and rheology in our models. The modelled surface topography, mantle flow stress, and orientation of maximum horizontal stress, derived from the variations in the crustal thickness, suggest that model with the lithospheric and upper-mantle heterogeneities is required to improve these modelled quantities. The model with upper-mantle thermal anomalies and east–west compression of approximately 50 MPa developed a stress field consistent with the observed seismicity in the KP. However, the modelled and observed orientations of the maximum horizontal stress agree in the western KP but they are inconsistent in the eastern KP. Our analysis, based on the modelled quantities, suggested that compressional stress and mantle heterogeneities may mainly control the seismicity in the western area. In contrast, we found a clear correlation of the relatively thin lithosphere and strong upper-mantle upwelling with the observed seismicity in the Eastern KP, but it is unclear whether stress, driven by these heterogeneities, directly affects the seismicity of the upper crust.",Numerical modelling;Seismic tomography;Dynamics: seismotectonics;Intra-plate processes;Rheology: crust and lithosphere;Rheology: mantle,,"School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea; rhie@snu.ac.kr; Center for Earthquake Research and Information, University of Memphis, 3890 Central Ave., Memphis, TN 38152, USA; Department of Geological Sciences, University of Florida, 241 Williamson Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea; rhie@snu.ac.kr; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea; rhie@snu.ac.kr; Center for Earthquake Research and Information, University of Memphis, 3890 Central Ave., Memphis, TN 38152, USA"

Quesenbery,2023,2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,0,"The Common Habitat is the primary habitable element in a conceptual architecture feasibility study for long-duration space exploration with an eight-person crew size. On lunar or planetary surfaces, the Common Habitat forms the core of a Surface Base Camp. In microgravity, the Common Habitat is the core of the Deep Space Exploration Vehicle (DSEV), an in-space transportation spacecraft. The Common Habitat employs a horizontal orientation that is divided internally into a lower deck, mid deck, and upper deck, roughly separating outfitting into individual, work, and group functions. On a planetary surface, the habitat is incorporated into a base camp, located near the south pole in the case of the Moon. The Mars base camp is currently location agnostic. Each base camp is divided into habitation, landing, resource production, and power zones. In microgravity, the habitat is incorporated into the Deep Space Exploration Vehicle, a vessel capable of transporting the crew within the inner solar system. In addition to crew and teleoperated control of external science assets, the Common Habitat employs a suite of life and physical science laboratory systems to enable it to support science investigations across a variety of destination environments, primarily featuring the Moon and Mars, along with the intervening interplanetary space. Other potential destinations include Near Earth Asteroids and Venus and Earth orbits. Located in the aft starboard section of the Common Habitat mid deck, the life science laboratory supports primarily biology and human research. In its baseline configuration, the laboratory includes horizontal work surfaces, freezers, multiple gloveboxes, sample transfer/exposure capability, large instruments, and reconfigurable ISPR-compatible payload bays. The Medical Care Facility and exercise facility can also support life science research. In the aft port section of the mid deck, the physical science laboratory supports physics, chemistry, materials science, geology, and remote sensing (including astrophysics, heliophysics, Earth science, planetary science, and meteorology). It provides a baseline of similar ISPR-compatible payload bays and adds additional freezers, including those for cryogenic sample storage, a remote sensing workstation, more gloveboxes, also with sample transfer/exposure, combustion chambers, fluid mechanics chambers, and a gas chromatograph. It leverages the Command & Control Center for teleoperations of mobile science assets.

Masazade,2023,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,IEEE Journals,0,"Lane Keeping Assistance and Adaptive Cruise Control in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) requires road parameters for better control of the vehicle. Therefore, in this paper we present the Iterative Least Squares with Optimization (ILSO) method based on a monocular front camera which estimates the horizontal, vertical parameters, lateral slope and the camera’s distances to the left/right line as road parameters and longitudinal range. The ILSO algorithm is smartly divided into two steps LS and optimization depending on their estimation capabilities. First of all, the horizontal and vertical parameters, lateral slope, and distances to the left and right lines are estimated by Least Squares (LS). Then, the longitudinal range is estimated by convex optimization. LS and convex optimization are executed in an alternating manner. ILSO is in advance prior to changes on roads and a simple technique due to its analytical solution which does not require complex geometric calculations and does not need a match between left and right lines. In a simulation environment, given the noisy road lines, ILSO outperforms covariance based and multilayer perceptron (MLP) based methods under different noise variances. In addition, ILSO provides plausible numerical results in both virtual and real road images.",Road parameters estimation;3D road modeling;monocular camera;least squares;optimization,,"Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Institute of Sciences, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey"
2281,Multistage elastic full-waveform inversion for tilted transverse isotropic media,J. -W. Oh; Y. Shin; T. Alkhalifah; D. -J. Min,2020,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,1,"Seismic anisotropy is an important physical phenomenon that significantly affects wave propagation in complex sedimentary basins. When geological structures exhibit steep dips or severe folding, the symmetry axis of the transversely isotropic (TI) representation of the region can be rotated, leading to tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media. We seek to find the optimal full-waveform inversion (FWI) strategy to estimate both the seismic velocities and the anisotropic parameters, including the tilt angle, in the presence of elastic TTI media. We first formulate the forward and inverse problems for elastic TTI media and analyse the radiation patterns of the model parameters. Based on the analyses of the radiation patterns, we propose two similar multistage FWI strategies that add inversion parameters over three stages, beginning with the isotropic parameters (horizontal P- and vertical S-wave velocity) and moving to the anisotropic parameters; the tilt angle is directly inverted in the last stage. Since diving waves, which are useful for providing long-wavelength updates, are mainly controlled by horizontal motion in anisotropic media, it is reasonable to choose the horizontal P-wave velocity rather than the vertical P-wave velocity. Then, the anisotropic parameters are inverted mainly using the reflected waves based on the isotropic background model built in the first stage. The main difference between the two multistage FWI strategies is whether the anisotropic parameter η is inverted. Comparing the two multistage FWI strategies with the simultaneous inversion strategy for a downsized version of the synthetic BP TTI model, we confirm that the multistage FWI strategies yield better inversion results than the simultaneous inversion strategy. When we compare the two multistage FWI strategies with each other for surface seismic data, ignoring η during the FWI process (focused multistage FWI) yields better inversion results for the tilt angle than those obtained with the inversion of η because η has less influence on the FWI than the other parameters and is not recovered well, which plays a role in degrading the tilt angle. Numerical examples support our conclusions that the focused multistage FWI strategy (neglecting η) is the optimal FWI strategy for TTI media and achieves computational efficiency for surface seismic data.",Elasticity and anelasticity;Waveform inversion;Seismic anisotropy,,"Department of Resources and Energy Engineering, Jeonbuk National University, 567, Baekje-daero, Deokjin-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do 54896, Republic of Korea; Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), Mineral Resources Research Division, 124, Gwahak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34132, Republic of Korea; Physical Science and Engineering Division, 4700, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal 23955–6900, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Seoul National University, 1, Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea; spoppy@snu.ac.kr"

It utilizes the 3D Integrated Circuit advantages to allow the die with the same layer function to stack together. The 3D Network Bridge (3D‐NB) provides an additional routing resource to support neural network massive interconnect and power requirements. The power is distributed from the lower die to the upper one through 3D‐NB horizontal Redistribution Layer and vertical Through Silicon Via connection and avoids the pyramid‐shaped Power Distribution Network design. The two‐level power gating is an effective approach to shut down the part of layers to save the power for neural network processing. The power gating separates the power rail into the global and virtual power using the power switch control.

2283,Spatial relationship between shallow very low frequency earthquakes and the subducted Kyushu-Palau Ridge in the Hyuga-nada region of the Nankai subduction zone,T. Tonegawa; Y. Yamashita; T. Takahashi; M. Shinohara; Y. Ishihara; S. Kodaira; Y. Kaneda,2020,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"Shallow very low frequency earthquakes (sVLFEs) have occurred recurrently at the shallow plate interface of the Hyuga-nada region of the western Nankai subduction zone, Japan. Although the locations of sVLFE epicentres have been determined using land-based seismic records with moderate accuracy, it is necessary to determine their locations more precisely to explore the relationship between sVLFEs and other shallow slow earthquakes and examine the structural factors that may control sVLFE activity. Here, we identified sVLFE epicentres using seismic records obtained from temporarily deployed ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) in the Hyuga-nada region. Seismic observations involved the deployment of 5–13 OBSs for approximately 1 yr, with deployments conducted three times during 2014–2016 each time with changing OBS numbers and array distribution. As a result, one sVLFE episode, containing successive Rayleigh wave pulses with slow velocities due to marine sediments, could be detected at a frequency band of 0.1–0.15 Hz per observation, resulting in a total of three episodes. Rayleigh wave amplitudes of ordinary earthquakes in the continuous records were suppressed using earthquake catalogues. We estimated the dispersion curve for the Rayleigh wave group velocity for each array, which represented the averaged group velocity within the array, using coda interferometry, and applied an envelope correlation method (ECM) using the group velocities to continuous records. These processing provided sVLFE epicentres with horizontal distance errors of <5 km. Our results showed that sVLFEs depths, which were inferred from the contour line of the top of the Phillipine Sea Plate, had increased from <10 km to 10–15 km in the region of the subducted Kyusyu-Palau Ridge (KPR). It was also apparent that migration of sVLFE epicentres occurred in 2015 from a depth of 15 km to shallower depths along the northern margin of the subducted KPR. These results identified the subducted KPR as a structural factor controlling the excitation conditions of sVLFE activities.",Coda waves;Seismic interferometry;Subduction zone processes,,"Research Institute for Marine Geophysics, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), 3173-25, Showa-machi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; tonegawa@jamstec.go.jp; Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University, 3884, Kaeda, Miyazaki 889–2161, Japan; Research Institute for Marine Geophysics, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), 3173-25, Showa-machi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; Earthquake Research Institute, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1, Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku 113-0032, Japan; Research Institute for Marine Geophysics, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), 3173-25, Showa-machi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; Research Institute for Marine Geophysics, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), 3173-25, Showa-machi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; Research Institute for Marine Geophysics, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), 3173-25, Showa-machi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; Research and Regional Cooperation For Crisis Management Shikoku, Kagawa University, 2217–20, Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 761-0396, Japan"
2284,Longevity of small-scale (‘baby’) plumes and their role in lithospheric break-up,A. Koptev; S. Cloetingh; T. A. Ehlers,2021,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"Controversy between advocates of ‘active’ (plume-activated) versus ‘passive’ (driven by external tectonic stresses) modes of continental rifting and break-up has persisted for decades. To a large extent, inconsistencies between observations and models are rooted in the conceptual model of plumes as voluminous upwellings of hot material sourced from the deep mantle. Such large-scale plumes are expected to induce intensive magmatism and topographic uplift, thereby triggering rifting. In this case of an ‘active’ rifting-to-break-up system, emplacement of plume-related magmatism should precede the onset of rifting that is not observed in many rifted continental margins, thus providing a primary argument in favour of an antiplume origin for continental break-up and supercontinent fragmentation. However, mantle plumes are not restricted to whole-mantle (‘primary’) plumes emanating from the mantle-core boundary but also include ‘secondary’ plumes originating from the upper mantle transition zone or shallower. Over the last decades a number of such ‘secondary’ plumes with horizontal diameters of only ∼100–200 km (therefore, sometimes also called ‘baby’ plumes) have been imaged in the upper mantle below Europe and China. The longevity of such small-scale plumes and their impact on geodynamics of continental break-up have so far not been explored. We present results of a systematic parametrical analysis of relatively small thermal anomalies seeded at the base of the lithosphere. In particular, we explore the effects of variations in initial plume temperature (T = 1500–1700 °C) and size (diameter of 80–116 km), characteristics of the overlying lithosphere (e.g. ‘Cratonic’, ‘Variscan’, ‘Mesozoic’ and oceanic) and intraplate tectonic regimes (neutral or far-field extension of 2–10 mm yr–1). In tectonically neutral regimes, the expected decay time of a seismically detectable ‘baby’-plume varies from ∼20 to >200 Myr and is mainly controlled by its initial size and temperature, whereas the effect of variations in the thermotectonic age of the overlying lithosphere is modest. These small but enduring plumes are able to trigger localized rifting and subsequent continental break-up occurring from ∼10 to >300 Myr after the onset of far-field extension. Regardless of the thermomechanical structure of the lithosphere, relatively rapid (tens of Myr) break-up (observed in models with a hot plume and fast extension) favours partial melting of plume material. In contrast, in the case of a long-lasting (a few hundreds of Myr) pre-break-up phase (relatively cold plume, low extension rate), rifting is accompanied by modest decompressional melting of only ‘normal’ sublithospheric mantle. On the basis of the models presented, we distinguish two additional modes of continental rifting and break-up: (1) ‘semi-active’ when syn-break-up magmatism is carrying geochemical signatures of the deep mantle with deformation localized above the plume head not anymore connected by its tail to the original source of hot material and (2) ‘semi-passive’ when the site of final lithospheric rupture is controlled by a thermal anomaly of plume origin but without invoking its syn-break-up melting. These intermediate mechanisms are applicable to several segments of the passive continental margins formed during Pangea fragmentation.",,,"Department of Geosciences, University of Tübingen, Tübingen 72074, Germany; alexander.koptev@ifg.uni-tuebingen.de; Tectonics Research Group, Utrecht University, Utrecht 3584 CS, Netherlands; Department of Geosciences, University of Tübingen, Tübingen 72074, Germany"

Most recent researches simplified the finger tapping motion as a scissors-like motion, though the rotation axis of the thumb was different from that of the forefinger. In this paper, we proposed a three-dimensional (3-D) finger tapping measurement system to obtain 3-D pattern features in finger tapping test for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The proposed system collected the motion of the thumb and the forefinger by nine-degrees-freedom sensors and calculated 3-D motion of finger tapping by an orientation estimation method and a 3-D finger-tapping kinematic model. We further extracted 3-D pattern features, i.e. motor coordination and relative thumb motion, from 3-D Finger Tapping motion. Moreover, we used the proposed system to collect the finger-tapping motion of 43 PD patients and 30 healthy controls in horizontal tasks and vertical tasks. The results indicated that 3-D pattern features showed a better performance than one-dimensional features in the identification of mild PD patients.Clinical Relevance— These three-dimensional pattern features could be used to evaluate finger tapping motion in a novel way, which could be used to better identify mild Parkinson’s disease patients.

The loop profile significantly influences the reliability of wire bonding, and it is necessary to study the wire bond looping process. The loop profile of the bonding wire is determined by the tension and material property of bonding wire as well as the trace and structure of capillary, in which the capillary trace has a major impact on the wire bond loop profile. At present, in the production practice of semiconductor industry, the settings of capillary motion parameters are mainly based on engineering experience. The influence of capillary trace on the loop profile is still unclear, which induces the loop profile is difficult to control. In this study, the influence of capillary trace on the looping process was investigated by finite element method on the software ANSYS LS-DYNA. The simulation results show that the lower the loop height is, the closer the horizontal position of highest point is to the first bonding point, the larger is the von Mise stress of the first bonding point. Loop height can be increased by rising kink height, reducing flat length, and the span of the highest point. The curvature of loop can be increased by increasing the height of the capillary motion and conversion, while overlarge conversion angle deteriorates the reliability of the loop. When the horizontal position of the highest point of the loop is located between the first bonding point and the center of the loop, the loop profile has ideal tensile strength and stability.

In vivo distribution of SPIONs can be imaged with the Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) method, which uses an inhomogeneous magnetic field with a field free region (FFR). The spatial distribution of the SPIONs are obtained by scanning the FFR inside the field of view (FOV) and sensing SPION related magnetic field disturbance. MPI magnets can be configured to generate a field free point (FFP), or a field free line (FFL) to scan the FOV. FFL scanners provide more sensitivity, and are also more suitable for scanning large regions compared to FFP scanners. Interventional procedures will benefit greatlyfrom FFL based open magnet configurations.

Due to the asymmetric form of the probability density function (pdf) in each retinal layer, a generalized version of multivariate Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) model, which we refer to as GM-GSM model, is proposed for each retinal layer. In this model, the pixel intensities in each retinal layer are modeled with an asymmetric Bessel K Form (BKF) distribution as a specific form of the GM-GSM model. Then, by combining some layers together, a mixture of GM-GSM model with eight components is proposed. The proposed model is then easily converted to a multivariate Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) to be employed in the spatially constrained GMM denoising algorithm. The Q-Q plot is utilized to evaluate goodness of fit of each component of the final mixture model. The improvement in the noise reduction results based on the GM-GSM model, indicates that the proposed statistical model describes the OCT data more accurately than other competing methods that do not consider spatial dependencies between neighboring pixels.",Bessel K-form distribution;Gamma distribution;Gaussian scale mixture;multivariate statistical modeling;optical coherence tomography;spatial dependency;speckle noise reduction,,"Student Research Committee, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran; Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran; Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"

Zeng,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,IEEE Journals,3,"Biomedical microscopy images with high-resolution (HR) and axial information can help analysis and diagnosis. However, obtaining such images usually takes more time and economic costs, which makes it impractical in most scenarios. In this paper, we first propose a novel Self-texture Transfer Super-resolution and Refocusing Network (STSRNet) to reconstruct HR multi-focal plane (MFP) images from a single 2D low-resolution (LR) wide field image without relying on scanning or any special devices. The proposed STSRNet consists of three parts: the backbone module for extracting features, the self-texture transfer module for transferring and fusing features, and the flexible reconstruction module for SR and refocusing. Specifically, the self-texture transfer module is designed for images with self-similarity such as cytological images and it searches for similar textures within the image and transfers to help MFP reconstruction. As for reconstruction module, it is composed of multiple pluggable components, each of which is responsible for a specific focal plane, so as to performs SR and refocusing all focal planes at one time to reduce computation. We conduct extensive experiments on cytological images and the experiments show that MFP images reconstructed by STSRNet have richer details in the axial and horizontal directions than input images. At the same time, the reconstructed MFP images also perform better than single 2D wide field images on high-level tasks. The proposed method provides relatively high-quality MFP images when real MFP images cannot be obtained, which greatly expands the application potential of LR wide-field images.

In the proposed method, multiple co-centered circular arrays are arranged on the horizontal plane and an additional loudspeaker is located at the array's center. The sound field produced by this center loudspeaker is then cancelled using the multiple circular arrays. A localized 3D sound zone can thus be generated inside a sphere with a maximum radius of that of the circular arrays because the residual sound field is contained within the sphere. The resulting sound fields are decomposed into spherical harmonic spectra and the driving function of the array is then obtained. Compared with the conventional approach that uses monopole pairs to control the even and odd spherical harmonic spectrum components, the proposed method can be simply realized with a practical planar omni-directional array because it is sufficient to control the 0-th order component.

It can provide not only important reference for rational management and control of natural resources, but also important information for studying global environmental changes. Land use is an important basis for rational utilization, planning, protection and scientific management of land resources, and a prerequisite for doing all kinds of land management work well. Spatial planning index system is an important starting point for the decomposition and implementation of land resources planning objectives, which not only concretizes and quantifies the content framework of spatial planning, but also provides measurement basis for monitoring and evaluation of planning implementation. Remote sensing technology is potentially useful in such planning. It is of great theoretical and practical significance for the country to understand the application status and development of satellite technology in various industries to improve the practicality and to formulate relevant policies, and it is also the starting point and foothold of this study. The control space and management contents of various spatial planning at all levels overlap, and there are differences in data base and policy objectives, resulting in horizontal contradictions and conflicts in the corresponding planning index system and vertical transmission disconnections or lack of error corrections, which seriously weakens the guidance and restraint of spatial planning on land space utilization and ecological resource protection.

2301,Highly Polarized Optical Harmonic Generation into Zero-Order Diffraction from Gradient Semiconductor Metasurfaces,G. Marino; C. Gigli; D. Rocco; I. Favero; A. Lemaître; C. De Angelis; G. Leo,2019,2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Summary form only given. All-dielectric optical metasurfaces consist of two-dimensional arrangements of nanoresonators and are of great importance for shaping polarization, phase and amplitude of both linear and harmonic light waves. Up to date, their reported nonlinear optical properties have been dominated by the local features of the individual nanoresonators [1-3]. However, collective responses typical of either Mie-resonant metamaterials or photonic crystals can potentially boost the control over such optical properties. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of second harmonic with zero-order diffraction from quadratically nonlinear metasurfaces, made out of AlGaAs-on-AlOx nanocylinders with spatial period comparable with a pump wavelength in the optical telecom range. Upon normal incidence of the pump beam, we demonstrate that the modulation of Mie-resonances via Bragg scattering at both fundamental and second harmonic frequencies enables paraxial second harmonic light diffraction back into the zero order, based on effective optical properties. This zero-order second harmonic (SH) diffraction results in a 50-fold increase of the detected harmonic power within a solid angle of 5° (see Figure 1). Moreover, 90% of the incident polarization is converted in the SH cross-polarized component, in contrast to around 40% measured previously for isolated nano-antennas [4-7]. This is achieved by a stronger coupling of the incident light with the metasurface resonances at both fundamental and harmonic frequencies with respect to the original Mie-resonances of the isolated constituents. In addition, upon pumping a polarization-gradient χ(2) metasurface with varying incident polarizations, highly horizontal and diagonal linear polarized zero-order SH states can be achieved. Our results demonstrate that higher control of polarization, phase, and amplitude of the harmonic wavefront can be achieved in diffractive all-dielectric nonlinear metasurfaces, with applications for on-axis optical imaging.",,,"Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques, Université Paris Diderot & CNRS, Paris, France; Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques, Université Paris Diderot & CNRS, Paris, France; Dept. of Information Engineering, Università degli Studi di Brescia & INO-CNR, Brescia, Italy; Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques, Université Paris Diderot & CNRS, Paris, France; Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, CNRS - Université Paris-Saclay, France; Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, CNRS - Université Paris-Saclay, France; Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques, Université Paris Diderot & CNRS, Paris, France"

The present perimetry, which is defined as the measurement of visual field function, has high requirements for patients such as long-term fixation and reliable interaction with the system. In this pilot study, we combined the videos and eye-tracking techniques in a free-watching task and explored the different eye movement behaviors of people with several types of artificial VFDs, such as hemianopia, altitudinal VFDs, and tunnel vision. We carried out the task in a gaze-contingent modality where 38 participants with normal vision were recruited to watch a group of videos monocularly. The eye gaze data were recorded by the tracker during the task. We hypothesized that people with simulated VFDs will produce a more active eye movement coping mechanism to compensate for their visual field disadvantage. A new measurement called eye movement amount (MA) was proposed to describe the amount of eye movement toward a specific direction. Statistically significant differences caused by artificial VFDs were observed by comparing the MA values between the VFD groups and the control group. In addition, we found artificial hemianopia and inferior VFDs lead participants to produced increased MA in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively.

Satellite observations were utilized to estimate surface albedo at global and regional scales with good precision over flat areas. However, because topography greatly complicates radiative transfer (RT) processes, estimating the albedo of rugged terrain with satellite data remains a challenge. In addition, albedo definitions over sloping terrain differ from that for flat areas. They include horizontal/horizontal sloped surface albedo (HHSA) and inclined/inclined sloped surface albedo (IISA). Methods for retrieving HHSA and IISA in mountains have not been well-explored. Here, we retrieved HHSA and IISA on sloping terrain from Landsat 8 using a direct estimation algorithm. We simulated a dataset of Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface albedo with discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model, for variable atmospheric, vegetation, soil, and topography properties. Then, we used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to derive an empirical relationship between TOA reflectance and surface albedo. The accuracy of our method was verified with in situ measurements: root mean squared error (RMSE) and bias equal to 0.029 and −0.010 for HHSA, and 0.023 and −0.001 for IISA, respectively. Several albedo results (HHSA, IISA, values without topographic consideration) were evaluated and compared. HHSA was found similar to albedo without topographic consideration, but IISA, considered as the “true albedo” for sloping terrain, showed large difference from them.

Rao,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,1,"With the development of horizontal Wells and extended reach Wells in the field of oil and gas exploitation, it is of great significance to the development of MWD which can measure the drilling trajectory in real time. Therefore, in recent years, Measurement while drilling (MWD) has been widely recognized and rapidly developed in the field of precise target drilling. Accelerometers and fluxgates are related to well trajectory measurement in the MWD. The external environment and the processing and installation error of the sensor lead to some errors in the measured value. Deviation caused by environmental interference and installation error leads to the low control precision of drilling tool attitude. In view of the shortcomings of the current calibration methods and the time-consuming and complicated operation of the traditional tri-axis orthogonal inclinometer calibration, this paper proposes the attitude error calibration method of the MWD based on the support vector classifier and the K-proximity method. First, a neural network model is established based on the measured calibration results and the measurements errors. Then, the K-proximity method is used to further classify the drill tool attitude data, and a neural network model combining the K-proximity method is constructed. Secondly, the software and hardware experimental platform for on-line calibration of the slant meter while drilling is built by using the calibration frame and the geomagnetic sensor. Finally, the experimental results showed that the mean deviation of well inclination angle and tool face angle is controlled within ±0.2°, and the mean deviation of azimuth is controlled within ±0.5°, which verified that the algorithm can increase accurate of drilling tool attitude.",MWD;attitude angle calculation;installation error;tri-axial orthogonal inclinometer measurement;down-hole dynamic calibration,,"School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China; School of Mechatronic Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China"
2310,A Compact Circularly Polarized Antenna With Directional Pattern for Wearable Off-Body Communications,U. Ullah; I. B. Mabrouk; S. Koziel,2019,IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters,IEEE Journals,41,"This letter presents a geometrically simple and compact circularly polarized antenna with unidirectional radiation characteristics for off-body communications. The proposed antenna is based on a microstrip-line monopole extension from a coplanar waveguide and a protruded stub from one side of the coplanar ground plane along the length of the monopole. The orthogonal components of equal amplitudes required for circular polarization are induced using the vertical stub and the horizontal edge of the coplanar ground plane. To control the radiation of the antenna towards the human body, a flexible, high-permittivity laminated substrate is used as a reflector. The topological simplicity of the antenna permits a small number of adjustable variables and therefore a reduced computational cost of the parameter tuning process. The total footprint of the proposed antenna is only 0.23λo × 0.24λo = 0.05 λo2 at the lowest operating frequency. The antenna is numerically and experimentally characterized in the free space and on a real human volunteer. The simulated and measured reflection coefficient indicates that the operating range of the antenna extends from 5.16 to 6.13 GHz range with 100% bandwidth overlap between the impedance bandwidth and the axial-ratio bandwidth. The peak gain of the antenna is 6.22 dBic with a stable radiation pattern in the +z-direction, high efficiency of 90%, and 0.131 W/g specific absorption rate (SAR).

Yu,2021,2021 Photonics & Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS),IEEE Conferences,1,"Automotive millimeter wave radars are currently widely used in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), such as in ACC, AEB, BSD and other systems. Millimeter wave radars mainly complete target detection and environmental perception tasks. The output data includes relative distance, relative angle, relative speed, radar reflection cross-sectional and other parameters, which then will be handed over to the controller to complete the target calculation. Finally, it will formulate the corresponding control strategy to issue the actuator. As the main source of target information, millimeter wave radar has become particularly important in its detection performance. Because of the high cost, poor repeatability and long test period, at present, the target detection performance test of millimeter wave radar mainly adopts the form of target simulator. The target simulator can simulate the position, distance and speed of the target by cooperating with a high-precision turntable or manipulator to complete the calibration test of basic parameters. The traditional radar target simulator uses a single-channel transceiver to simulate a body target as a single reflection point. In conventional road scenes, the proportion of large-scale vehicle targets is very high. Simplifying it into a single point can easily cause the lack of target characteristics, and cannot effectively verify the radar’s ability to recognize large-scale targets. This article provides a way to simulate a target based on an antenna array, which uses a multichannel transceiver system, and a high-speed RF channel switch to complete the continuous variations of the target orientation. Based on the reflection characteristics database of the target at different azimuth angles, there are multiple strong reflection points for a physical target, which can be achieved by combining multiple point targets. After the consideration of economy and final effect, we chose three point targets to synthesize a body target. The synthesized body target can be modified freely in orientation, horizontal posture, distance, and speed. For typical targets such as pedestrians, cars, vans, and bicycles, the target simulation system we proposed can achieve more realistic target reflection characteristics. At the same time, the target simulation system can produce multiple targets which represent multiple traffic participants. The relative motion between them can be applied to reproduce the real traffic scene Therefore, the logic function test of the hardware-in-loop simulation can be carried out for the ADAS system based on millimeter wave radar.",,,"Tongji University, China; Shanghai Motor Vehicle Testing and Certification Technology Research Center Co., Ltd., China; Shanghai Motor Vehicle Testing and Certification Technology Research Center Co., Ltd., China; Shanghai Motor Vehicle Testing and Certification Technology Research Center Co., Ltd., China; Tongji University, China"

Based on the packaging method in its data sheet, the finite element model of the stacked solder joints was built using ANSYS software, and the effect of the morphological parameters of the stacked joints on their maximum stress under torsional loading conditions was analyzed. Firstly, the three parameters of solder ball diameter, solder joint height, and pad diameter were selected as the control factors, and the stacked solder joint stress was used as the target value. The Box-Behnken method was used to obtain 17 sets of horizontal combinations of different morphological parameters of the stacked solder joints. After that, the torsional stresses were simulated for each of the 17 finite element models established. Finally, the response surface method was used to fit the stress values to the morphological parameters of the solder joints in the 17 sets of simulations to obtain the regression equations and to perform the simulation verification of the optimal combination of morphological parameters of the stacked solder joints. The results showed that: under torsional loading conditions, the force distribution within the stacked solder joint array and the force distribution of individual stacked solder joints are not uniform. The key solder joint in the overall model of the stacked solder joint is located at the farthest corner from the array of solder joints, and the maximum force value occurs at the outermost point of contact between the stacked solder joint and the PCB; According to the analysis results, the diameter of the solder ball, the height of the solder joint, and the diameter of the pad have significant effects on the torsional stress of the stacked solder joint; The response surface model is a good fit, when the solder ball diameter is 0.61 mm, the solder joint height is 0.50 mm and the pad diameter is 0.48 mm, the torsional equivalent force of the stacked solder joint is the smallest, 25.56 Mpa.

Pärssinen,2019,"2019 IEEE 30th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)",IEEE Conferences,1,"The performance of multi-user millimeter-wave (mmW) systems is limited by relatively high sidelobe levels (SLLs) of antenna arrays. Per-antenna amplitude control can be used to adjust the amplitudes to reduce the SLL, but the reduction is often achieved at the cost of reduced transmitted power. Large two-dimensional (2D) antenna panels used in mmW phased arrays, however, allow the 2D antenna configuration to be reconfigured to reduce the SLL. In this paper, we present a simplified approach for sidelobe reduction by stacking multiple uniform linear arrays of different size to reduce the sidelobes across the horizontal plane. The approach is based on the relation between the number of antenna elements and the directions of null and sidelobe maxima. The sidelobe reduction is demonstrated by both simulations and measurements.

Kikuma,2021,2020 50th European Microwave Conference (EuMC),IEEE Conferences,0,"In this work, two kinds of millimeter-wave E-plane transmission lines in multi-layer dielectric substrate and their transitions to the hollow waveguide are proposed and investigated. The transmission lines of E-plane SIW and finline in multi-layer dielectric substrate show advantages of low transmission loss and low profile, which are useful to design antennas and circuits in the millimeter-wave band. In the E-plane SIW structure, four dielectric substrates are stacked to compose an E-plane SIW. The utilization of thin dielectric substrates can control the cutoff frequency of E-plane SIW and significantly reduce leakage power of horizontal polarization between via holes. In the finline structure, a planar transmission line in E-plane is constructed by a slot line inserted in the middle metal pattern between two dielectric substrate layers. The finline is bounded within a closed structure composed of double-layer substrate and two rows of via-hole arrangement, therefore, low dispersion and low radiation loss can be expected in the finline performance. Waveguide transitions are designed for both transmission lines. The dimensions of the transitions were optimized by electromagnetic analysis of the finite element method at 76 GHz. Transmission loss of E-plane SIW and finline was 0.47 dB/cm and 0.3 dB/cm, respectively.

Singh,2019,2019 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (AP-RASC),IEEE Conferences,0,"Tropospheric ozone plays a key role in controlling the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere, and is a Short-Lived Climate forcing Pollutant (SLCP). Rapid changes in the emissions, land use, and regional climate are anticipated to intensify the tropospheric chemistry in South Asia during last two decades. Owing to the tropical convection together with strong horizontal winds aloft, the changes in tropospheric chemistry over South Asia influence the global atmospheric composition especially in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). However, in situ observations in the free troposphere are highly sparse over South Asia to study the long-term changes in this region and their impacts downwind. Here, we combine satellite retrievals (Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board the Aura spacecraft), model reanalysis (MACC; Monitoring Atmospheric Composition & Climate), and a regional climate model (WRF-Chem; Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry) to investigate the tropospheric ozone climatology and long-term trend over South Asia during 2005-2017 period. Satellite retrievals show elevated tropospheric ozone loading (~50 DU) along the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) during both pre-monsoon and the summer monsoon, and reveal strong inter-annual variations of 10-15 DU. A general increase in the Tropospheric Column Ozone (TCO) is observed across the South Asia in all the seasons. Wintertime TCO shows an increase over the western India and Northwest Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) with a statistically significant (p <; 0.05) trend of about 3% year-1, which agrees with the changes in the anthropogenic emissions in the region. Interestingly, during the post monsoon, ozone trends are most pronounced in the central to Southern Indian regions, and over the marine regions adjoining India. These results are further corroborated with the long-term satellite retrievals and model reanalysis fields of CO, NO2, and HCHO. Sensitivity simulations using a regional chemistry climate model (WRF-Chem) are being performed to analyze the role of large-scale dynamics, besides the regional photochemistry.",,,"Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India; Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India; Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India; Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India; Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Nainital, India"

2335,Joint multizonal transdimensional Bayesian inversion of surface wave dispersion and ellipticity curves for local near-surface imaging,M. Hallo; W. Imperatori; F. Panzera; D. Fäh,2021,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"Physical properties of near-surface soil and rock layers play a fundamental role in the seismic site effects analysis, being an essential element of seismic hazard assessment. Site-specific mechanical properties (i.e. shear- and compressional-wave velocities and mass density) can be inferred from surface wave dispersion and horizontal-to-vertical or ellipticity data by non-linear inversion techniques. Nevertheless, results typically exhibit significant inherent non-uniqueness as different models may fit the data equally well. Standard optimization inversion techniques minimize data misfit, resulting in a single representative model, rejecting other models providing similar misfit values. An alternative inversion technique can be formulated in the Bayesian framework, where the posterior probability density on the model space is inferred. This paper introduces an inversion approach of surface wave dispersion and ellipticity data based on a novel multizonal transdimensional Bayesian formulation. In particular, we parametrize 1-D layered velocity models by the varying number of Voronoi nuclei, allowing us to treat the number of layers as an unknown parameter of the inverse problem. The chosen parametrization leads to the transdimensional formulation of the model space, sampled by a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to provide an ensemble of random samples following the posterior probability density of model parameters. The used type of the sampling algorithm controls a model complexity (i.e. the number of layers) self-adaptively based on the measured data's information content. The method novelty lies in the parsimonious selection of sampling models and in the multizonal formulation of prior assumptions on model parameters, the latter allows including additional site-specific constraints in the inversion. These assumptions may be based on, e.g. stratigraphic logs, standard penetration tests, known water table, and bedrock depth. The multizonal formulation fully preserves the validity of the transdimensional one, as demonstrated analytically. The resultant ensemble of model samples is a discrete approximation of the posterior probability density function of model parameters and associated properties (e.g. VS30, quarter-wavelength average velocity profile and theoretical SH-wave amplification function). Although the ultimate result is the posterior probability density function, some representative models are selected according to data fit and maximum of the posterior probability density function. We first validate our inversion approach based on synthetic tests and then apply it to field data acquired from the active seismic survey and single-station measurements of ambient vibrations at the SENGL seismic station site in central Switzerland.",Inverse theory;Joint inversion;Probability distributions;Site effects;Surface waves and free oscillations;Crustal structure,,"Swiss Seismological Service, ETH Zurich, Zürich, 8092, Switzerland; miroslav.hallo@sed.ethz.ch; Swiss Seismological Service, ETH Zurich, Zürich, 8092, Switzerland; Swiss Seismological Service, ETH Zurich, Zürich, 8092, Switzerland; Swiss Seismological Service, ETH Zurich, Zürich, 8092, Switzerland"

In particular, relatively compact 20 T magnets can be achieved in a hybrid configuration, combining a High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) and a Low Temperature Superconductor (LTS). Preliminary concepts have been previously proposed using Bi2212 for the HTS and Nb3Sn for the LTS. One of the main difficulties of 20 T magnets is the management of the very high stresses developing during operation. The design concepts rely on a rectangular block-coil layout, which offers the advantage of aligning the conductors with the main magnetic field, therefore submitting the conductors to a perpendicular electromagnetic force for a better control of the stresses. In addition, the layout allows a specific stress management, with adequate horizontal and vertical plates to intercept the stresses. The paper presents the improvements provided to the initial concept. In terms of magnetic design, the field quality has been improved.

Zhao,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS),IEEE Conferences,0,"Passive millimeter and terahertz wave imaging systems have been demonstrated to detect a wide variety of concealed contrabands including explosives, handguns, and knifes1, 2. Although a variety of security systems have been developed, it is still difficult to reach the level of large-scale commercial application. The reason is not only the lack of radiometer performance, but also the insufficiency of obtained information (e.g., single or dual polarization and single frequency band data). When the radiometer hardware performance is given, how to improve detectivity is an important problem to be resolved. Multi-polarization imaging might contribute to improve the imaging performance. In this paper, we have constructed a novel experiment system of W-band passive imaging, which can generate multiple polarization images. The imaging system mainly contains a W-band radiometer, a focal plane lens, an arc-shaped orbit for horizontal pixel, a plane reflector for vertical pixel, and a control computer. The radiometer is placed on a rotating base of the arc-shaped orbit. When the radiometer has a linear polarized antenna, rotating the base around the observation direction can obtain arbitrary linear polarization. By replacing with left-hand or right-land circularly polarized antenna, we can acquire the corresponding circular polarization image. Scanning imaging time is about 20s. The temperature sensitivity is better than 1K. The equivalent spatial resolution is about 1cm.

The Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR) is essentially an “AMSU in GEO”, i.e. it has similar capabilities as AMSU would have if it were operating on a geostationary satellite, but with similar spatial resolution. GEO orbits are almost 50 times higher than the LEO orbits that current AMSUs operate from, and the corresponding scaling of aperture size required to maintain spatial resolution has stymied the development of such a sensor for many decades. The aperture synthesis approach implemented with GeoSTAR finally overcomes that obstacle, and the large number of microwave receivers and associated electronics required is made possible with new technology that has now been developed. A low-cost mission operating as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite has been designed and is “shovel-ready”. The objectives of such a mission could be to advance our understanding and modeling of storm processes that control rapid or explosive intensification of hurricanes, mesoscale convective systems, and extratropical cyclones, or it could be to support operational weather forecasting and nowcasting. Retrieval of temperature and water vapor profiles is possible even in the presence of moderate precipitation, and with the ability to derive horizontal wind vectors by tracking water vapor features, a rich set of parameters measuring the thermodynamics, dynamics and convection and sampled every 15 minutes, will enable significant progress in storm science and forecasting.",Atmospheric sounding;convection;precipitation;wind;storms;microwave;geostationary,,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"

Turbulence mostly occurs due to degeneration of mountain induced gravity waves and acts a potential source of vertical mixing in the atmosphere (Dornback, 1998). Inaccurate estimation of turbulence parameters will also have immense effect on the aviation sector in the complex mountainous regions. Another important application of the estimation of turbulence parameters is for astronomical observations since it determines the key parameters of adaptive optics systems and precision of astrometric measurements. Characterisation of turbulence in mountainous region is also vital to understand the dynamics of moxuntain waves and other mesoscale phenomenon which has crucial role in modulating the general circulation wind patterns (Palmer,1987). The flow conditions associated with the turbulence includes high vertical velocities, wind shear and low Richardson number which can be well measured with high vertical and temporal resolutions of wind fields (Horizontal and Vertical) by Stratosphere-Troposphere Radars. In this context, Estimation of Turbulence parameters like Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, ε and eddy diffusion coefficient, K_m will be determined by using standard Wind Variance method. This method utilizes the temporal spectrum of vertical wind in the inertial sub range demarcated by Brunt-Vaisala frequency and Nyquist frequency.

Additive manufacturing represents a promising and increasingly developing approach worldwide, although less attention is paid to studying the features of 3D-printed building components in the thermal field. In this paper, the thermal performance of a 3D-printed block is studied. The block is made up of recyclable plastic material, i.e., polylactic acid (PLA), with an internal honeycomb composition. The performance was studied experimentally using a specially made Hot Box together with heat flow meter sensors and infrared thermography, assuming different orientations of the air cavities. The experimental campaigns were carried out by imposing steady-state, repeatable, and controlled conditions. The results obtained showed that the different orientation of the air cavities determines effects on heat transfer phenomena, with reductions of up to 7% in terms of thermal transmittance.

Working with interfolding and synfolding remagnetizations, the Small Circle Intersection (SCI) method allows finding the best solution of grouping that should correspond with the remagnetization direction. Once this is known, it is possible to determine the magnetization age as well as the degree of bed tilting at this moment. The SC tools are based on some assumptions, among which the coaxiality between the different deformation events is the one addressed in this work (i.e. absence of vertical axis rotations, VARs, or differential horizontal axis rotations, dHARs). This assumption is based on the necessity of knowing the rotation axis for folding after the acquisition of the remagnetization, and SC tools consider the bedding strike as this axis, something that is only accomplished under coaxial folding. In order to explore how non-coaxiality affects the solutions derived from the SC methods, we first (i) identify the variables that control these errors through simple models that only consider two theoretical palaeomagnetic sites, after that it is possible (ii) to derive the mathematical relationships between them.

This luminosity increase will result in a higher muon flux rate in the forward region and overwhelm the current trigger system of the CMS experiment. The MEO, a gas electron multiplier detector, is proposed for the Phase-2 Muon System Upgrade for the CMS experiment to help increase the muon acceptance and to control the Level 1 muon trigger rate. A recent design iteration of this detector features GEM foils that are segmented on both sides, which helps to lower the probability of high voltage discharges. However, during preliminary testing of the chamber, substantial crosstalk between readout sectors was observed. Here, we investigate, characterize, and quantify the crosstalk present in the detector, and also estimate the performance of the chamber as a result of this crosstalk via simulation results of the detector dead time, efficiency loss, and frontend electronics response. The results of crosstalk via signals produced by applying a square voltage pulse directly on the readout strips of the detector with a signal generator are summarized. We also present the efficacy of mitigation strategies including bypass capacitors and increasing the area of the HV segments on the third GEM foil in the detector. We find that the crosstalk is a result of capacitive coupling between the readout strips on the readout board and between the readout strips and the bottom of the third GEM foil. Our results show that the crosstalk generally follows a pattern where the largest magnitude of crosstalk is within the same azimuthal readout segment in the detector, and in the next-nearest horizontal segments in eta. Generally, the bypass capacitors and increased area of the HV segments successfully lower the crosstalk in the sectors where they are located; on average, we observe a maximum decrease of crosstalk in sectors previously experiencing crosstalk from (1.66±0.03)% to (1.11±0.02)% with all HV segments connected in parallel on the bottom of the third GEM foil, with the addition of an HV low-pass filter connected to this electrode, and an HV divider.

2361,Dynamo-based limit to the extent of a stable layer atop Earth's core,T. Gastine; J. Aubert; A. Fournier,2020,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"The existence of a stably stratified layer underneath the core–mantle boundary (CMB) has been recently revived by corroborating evidences coming from seismic studies, mineral physics and thermal evolution models. Such a layer could find its physical origination either in compositional stratification due to the accumulation of light elements at the top or the core or in thermal stratification due to the heat flux becoming locally subadiabatic. The exact properties of this stably stratified layer, namely its size $\mathcal {H}_s$ and the degree of its stratification characterized by the Brunt–Väisälä frequency N, are however uncertain and highly debated. A stable layer underneath the CMB can have crucial dynamical impacts on the geodynamo. Because of the inhibition of the convective motions, a stable layer is expected to primarily act as a low-pass filter on the magnetic field, smoothing out the rapidly varying and small-scale features by skin effect. To investigate this effect more systematically, we compute 70 global geodynamo models varying the size of the stably stratified layer from 0 to 300 km and its amplitude from N/Ω = 0 to N/Ω ≃ 50, Ω being the rotation rate. We show that the penetration of the convective flow in the stably stratified layer is controlled by the typical size of the convective eddies and by the local variations of the ratio N/Ω. Using quantitative measures of the degree of morphological semblance between the magnetic field obtained in numerical models and the geomagnetic field at the CMB, we establish an upper bound for the stable layer thickness $\mathcal {H}_s\lt (N/\Omega )^{-1} \mathcal {L}_s$, $\mathcal {L}_s$ being the horizontal size of the convective flow at the base of the stable layer. This defines a strong geomagnetic constraint on the properties of a stably stratified layer beneath the CMB. Unless unaccounted double-diffusive effects could drastically modify the dynamics of the stable layer, our numerical geodynamo models hence favour no stable stratification atop the core.",Composition and structure of the core;Core;Dynamo: theories and simulations;Numerical modelling,,"Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Université Paris-Diderot, UMR 7154 CNRS, 1 rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; gastine@ipgp.fr; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Université Paris-Diderot, UMR 7154 CNRS, 1 rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; gastine@ipgp.fr; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Université Paris-Diderot, UMR 7154 CNRS, 1 rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; gastine@ipgp.fr"

In experiments without cesium injection, all SPIDER plants were tested to verify the basic expectations on the operational parameters (e.g., electron cooling effectiveness of magnetic filter field) and to determine its operational region. For beam properties, it was shown that the current density varies across the beam in the vertical direction. In preliminary cesium experiments, the expected increase of negative ion current and simultaneous decrease of co-extracted electrons were found, along with the influence of the control parameters (polarization of the plasma electrodes, magnetic filter field) on the SPIDER beam uniformity in the horizontal and vertical directions. It was shown that non-Gaussian tails can be identified in the angular distribution on the plane perpendicular to the beam propagation direction. Stray particles, nonhomogeneous beam and large divergence might result in unexpected heat and particle loads over ITER neutral beam injector (NBI) accelerator grids; it is the goal of SPIDER to assess and possibly to identify suitable methods for controlling these beam features. A major shutdown, planned for late 2021, to solve the issues identified during the operation and to carry out scheduled modifications, is outlined.

Reinforcement learning, unlike conventional machine learning methods such as supervised learning does not require large, labeled datasets thereby providing opportunities for more efficient and unbiased design optimization. With the objective of determining the optimal locations of sensors in a greenhouse, a multi-arm bandit problem was formulated using the Beta distribution and solved by the Thompson sampling algorithm. A total of 56 two-in-one sensors designed to measure both internal air temperature and relative humidity were installed at a vertical distance of 1 m and a horizontal distance of 3m apart in a greenhouse used to cultivate strawberries. Data was collected over a period of seven months covering four major seasons, February (winter), March, April, and May (spring), June and July (summer), and October (autumn) and analyzed separately. Results showed unique patterns for sensor selection for temperature and relative humidity during the different months. Furthermore, temperature and relative humidity each had different optimal location selections suggesting that two-in-one sensors might not be ideal in these cases.

2366,PRIMA: Subscriber-Driven Interference Mitigation for Cloud Services,J. Mukherjee; D. Krishnamurthy,2020,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,IEEE Journals,7,"Network services, e.g., video streaming services, are increasingly being deployed on public cloud platforms. Such services often employ horizontal scaling where a group of resource instances, e.g., virtual machines (VMs), handle incoming workload. The response time of such services is often affected by interference, i.e., contention among resource instances belonging to multiple cloud subscribers for shared cloud resources. Most commercial cloud platforms do not support built-in mechanisms to detect interference and mitigate its impact. Consequently, subscribers of such platforms, i.e., network service providers, need to deploy their own mechanisms to ensure a specified end user response time target is continuously met even in the face of fluctuations in workload and interference. This paper describes PRIMA, our implementation of such a mechanism. PRIMA uses automated and controlled performance tests to build models that capture the joint impact of workload and interference on the response time of each resource instance employed by a service. It adapts the system to changing workload and interference conditions by using these models at runtime to control the number of instances in the system and the distribution of load among these instances. Unlike existing subscriber-oriented interference mitigation techniques in literature, PRIMA guarantees that a subscriber-specified response time threshold is satisfied at every resource instance assigned to a service. Furthermore, in contrast to these approaches PRIMA can help a subscriber avoid using more instances than necessary by automatically selecting at runtime the least number of instances required for handling the observed workload and interference. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of PRIMA in both private and public cloud environments. Results show that PRIMA outperforms competing approaches proposed by us and others, including those that are commonly used in practice. They also reveal that PRIMA can automatically calibrate its models at runtime to account for any model prediction errors.",Software performance;cloud computing;quality of service;predictive modeling,,"School of Information Technology, York University, Toronto, Canada; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"

Kawabe,2020,IEEE Transactions on Haptics,IEEE Journals,7,"Pseudo-haptic feedback takes advantage of a cross-modal integration between vision and haptics. Previous studies have shown that object stiffness can be rendered with pseudo-haptic feedback with external haptic inputs. This article explored whether the pseudo-haptic feedback was feasible with a mid-air action wherein no external haptic input was given. On each trial of the experiments, participants conduced a mid-air action to laterally move their hands as if they horizontally stretched an object in the display. In synchronized with the hands' motion, the object horizontally deformed. The magnitude of the object deformation varied with the horizontal distance between participants' hands (i.e., a hand distance). The ratio of deformation magnitudes to the hand distance (i.e., a deformation-to-distance ratio) was controlled; With a larger ratio, a smaller hand distance produced the maximum level of object deformation. The Poisson's ratio was also controlled; a higher Poisson's ratio produced a larger magnitude of vertical deformation. The participants were asked to report the stiffness of the objects with a five-point rating scale. Consequently, the stiffness rating decreased with the deformation-distance ratio and with the Poisson's ratio. The results indicate that pseudo-haptic stiffness can be rendered with mid-air action by manipulating the deformation-distance ratio and Poisson's ratio.",Pseudo-haptic feedback;Mid-air action;Stiffness;Poisson's ratio.,,"NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"

The basic structure of the quad-ridge resonator (QRR) contains four ridges located at the center around the cavities. With an appropriate combination of the main parameters (length and width of the resonator and heights of the ridges), the first three TE resonant modes can be flexibly controlled, and each mode can carry the signal of a channel. Compared with a traditional rectangular cavity, the QRR provides more design freedoms for controlling the first three TE resonant modes and features a wider spurious-free window. The electric field distributions of the QRR are thoroughly analyzed to guide the realization of a filtering response. Intracavity coupling is achieved by an all-iris structure, including horizontal and vertical coupling slots with offsets to the cavity center, capable of easy fabrication and assembly.

These indoor farms could be the key to solve food shortages in the world. Plant factories are operated in indoor spaces under controlled cultivation conditions such as light, temperature and humidity. Then, a multi-fan system (MFS) for single culture beds. The MFS had four fans which were installed on both the front and back sides of culture beds to generate airflow from two opposite horizontal directions by using the Internet of Things (IoT) via the access and connection of smartphone devices. The fans that push the air into the culture bed were air inlets while those that pull the air out of the culture bed were air outlets.

2373,Distribution and driving mechanisms of temperature inversion in the Bay of Bengal: modeling approach,K. M. A. Chowdhury; A. Al Karim; M. K. Alam,2022,OCEANS 2022 - Chennai,IEEE Conferences,0,"Observational temperature and salinity datasets are almost absent along the coastal regions, northern tip of the Bay of Bengal, and adjacent Andaman Sea, and thus, model study can give more insights in this region. However, very few model studies are done on temperature inversion and most of them are confined to the part of this bay. Thus, the main objective is to investigate the mechanism in the formation and intensification of temperature inversion utilizing a high resolution (horizontal resolution 0.07° x 0.07° with 50 vertical layer) Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in the Bay of Bengal. Monthly distribution of temperature inversion in the study area derived from ROMS model simulation is presented and compared with that of the monthly mean climatology of WOA datasets. To reveal more detailed picture of temperature inversion, daily snapshots of the distribution of temperature inversion are also derived from the model. The basin averaged mixed layer heat- and salt-budget analyses are conducted to quantify the controlling factors of the mixed layer temperature and salinity. Monthly averaged temperature inversion from model simulation exhibits seasonal cycle similar to WOA datasets. Monthly mean temperature inversion from model exhibits that it develops during June, slowly increases till October, and then becomes maximum during November to the subsequent January. Inversion weakens in February and then vanishes in March. Daily averaged distribution of temperature inversion exhibits more occurrence of inversion than monthly averaged in this bay. In the northern Bay of Bengal, mixed later salinity tendency is always negative and thus, favorable in forming temperature inversion. However, model simulation depicts that only freshwater plume induced stratification is not a single driver in forming inversion in the Bay of Bengal. The net surface heat loss dominantly controls the temperature inversion in the northern Bay of Bengal throughout the year. In the southern Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer temperature tendency and mixed layer heat flux have the similar seasonal variation pattern but their tendencies are smaller than the northern Bay of Bengal. Therefore, the haline stratification is necessary condition in forming inversion but cooling tendency in mixed layer is essential for both formation and thickening the temperature inversion layer in the Bay of Bengal almost year-round.

The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\mathbf{CBAM}$ can be used to learn the vertical fusion factor of the FPN to control the information passed from deep to shallow layers. The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\mathbf{Query}$ acts as an fusion factor to control the horizontal transfer impact of FPN. $\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\mathbf{Query}$ first predicts the coarse locations of small objects in low-resolution feature maps and then increases their weights in high-resolution feature maps. Ablation studies on the publicly available dataset PASCAL VOC are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\mathbf{CBAM}$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\mathbf{Query}$.

To simplify the elasticity management, the trend is to create an auto-scaler instance per microservice, which controls its horizontal scalability by using the classic threshold-based policy. Although easy to implement, setting manually the scaling thresholds, which are usually statically-defined on a single metric, may lead to poor scaling decisions when applications are heterogeneous in terms of resource consumption. In this article, we study dynamic multi-metric threshold-based scaling policies, that exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) to autonomously update the scaling thresholds, one per controlled resource (CPU and memory). The proposed RL approaches (i.e., QL, MB, and DQL Threshold) use different degrees of knowledge about the system dynamics. To model the thresholds’ adaptation actions, we consider two RL-based architectures. In the single-agent architecture, one agent drives the updates of both scaling thresholds. To speed-up the learning, the multi-agent architecture adopts a distinct agent per threshold.

Through static load tests, certain control sections are selected for the main bridge and approach bridge respectively, and the strain and deflection of each control section of the structure under normal and eccentric load conditions, the maximum horizontal displacement of the top of the tower in the longitudinal direction of the bridge, and the cable of the suspender are tested. At the same time, the impact coefficient is tested based on the dynamic response test, and the vibration mode, natural frequency, and damping ratio of the suspension bridge are obtained by the environmental random pulsation method. Finally, the measured results are compared with the theoretical analysis results. The results show that the strain and deflection calibration coefficients of the bridge under the static load test are both less than 1, which meets the requirements of the specification, indicating that the overall rigidity of the bridge span structure tested is good under the test load; under dynamic load, when there is an obstacle, the driving speed reaches 5 km/h, the impact coefficient reaches the maximum value of 0.318.

In this study, assuming a partially observable and deterministic environment, reactive and deliberative behaviors of a hybrid scanning agent were controlled using some uninformed and informed search algorithms, respectively. As the reactive layer decided the agent actions online in an unknown environment, a map of the environment was constructed in parallel. When the reactive layer failed to find a proper action, the deliberative layer proposed a solution offline using the constructed map so that the agent could continue its scanning task. The navigation patterns that were produced with the adapted algorithms in the reactive and deliberative layers were analyzed. The results showed that depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms can be used as reactive motion planners for scanning an environment in zigzag and spiral patterns. Simulations in 25 grid-based environments with different sizes and varying percentages of obstacles yielded that running A* algorithm as a deliberative planner, the agent could completely scan the environments with equal successes for all different modes of the developed scanning algorithms.

Problems that may occur in electricity transmission lines are failure cause of many operations not only industrial but also daily life. One of the most important causes of the problems encountered in power lines is the change in the amount of sagging. The change of sagging amount causes line breaks and losing energy efficiency. This problem, which is frequently encountered due to seasonal and climatic changes, is one of the major problems of continuity in the power line. The calculation of sag contains uncertain and variable parameters that can change seasonally, climatically and/or structurally such as weight per unit length of the conductor, the horizontal component of tension, total tension, etc. In this case, it is difficult to calculate a precise and reliable sag amount. The sagging of power lines is generally calculated theoretically or measured on-site by the personnel in charge. In this study, a new approach is presented to measure the sag amount by using sensor data of a power line inspection robot, precisely and reliably.

A detailed explanation of the antenna behavior with respect to the addition of pairs of parasitic annular sectors is provided. Gradual addition of pairs of parasitic annular sectors along horizontal axis of the fed patch, reduces the spacing between fundamental TM11 mode of fed CMSA and TM01 mode of the parasitic annular sectors yielding wider bandwidth. Addition of first two pairs of parasitic annular sectors couples TM11 mode of fed circular microstrip antenna with TM01 mode of parasitic patches. Introduction of third and fourth pair of sectors tunes the impedance of TM01 mode realizing wider bandwidth of 710 MHz (53.58%).

Antenna exhibited broadside radiation pattern over the entire VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio) bandwidth.

It consists on a double pendulum system capable of transforming the wave oscillations into rotation on a flywheel. This rotation is converted into DC current by an electrical generator and further processed by a power management unit (PMU). The PMU includes a “maximum power point tracking” system to maximize energy production by the generator. An oceanic drifter has also been designed to embed the KEH and a custom-made measurement system to perform real sea tests. It counts on an Inertial Measurement Unit to study the motion of the drifter and an embedded measurement system to estimate the rotation speed of the generator and the power at both the input and output of the PMU. A Wi-Fi connection is also included for data transfer at short distances. The generator was firstly characterized at the laboratory; the drifter was then placed on a linear shaker to assess its performance. Finally, the drifter was deployed in a controlled sea area with average values of wave height and frequency of 1.43 m and 0.29 Hz, respectively. In these conditions, the drifter showed horizontal and vertical oscillations with peak-to-peak accelerations of 0.8 g and power spectra centered around 1.5 Hz and 1 Hz, respectively.

The constituent unit elements of a MTS have become increasingly complex with rise of anisotropic radio-frequency (RF) applications such as beam scanning through anomalous reflection/refraction, beam focusing, and polarization conversion in an extremely low-profile. Designing these meta-atoms or metagratings is a challenging and time-consuming procedure. Each new MTS design typically requires numerous iterations of manual tuning and full-wave simulations. In this paper, we employ deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DC-GANs) to generate anisotropic RF metamaterial unit cell designs for MTS arrays. Using a small set of simulated meta-atom spectra, these networks learn the relationship between the physical structure of meta-atoms and their reflection spectra for vertical and horizontal polarizations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that DC-GANs are able to generate meta-atom structures that resemble design features in the training data.

However, less research has been conducted on the manipulation of vertical movements and its possible use as a redirection technique. Actually, vertical movements are fundamentally important, e.g., for remotely steering a drone using a virtual reality headset.In this paper, we explored vertical gains, a novel redirection technique, which enables us to purposefully manipulate the mapping of the user’s physical vertical movements to movements in the virtual space and the remote space. This approach allows natural and more active physical control of a real drone. To demonstrate the usability of vertical gains, we implemented a telepresence drone and vertical redirection techniques for stretching and crouching actions using common VR devices. We conducted two user studies to investigate the effective manipulation ranges and its usability: one study using a virtual environment (VE), and one using a camera stream from a telepresence drone.

2384,VR Exploration Assistance through Automatic Occlusion Removal,L. Wang; J. Wu; X. Yang; V. Popescu,2019,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,IEEE Journals,15,"Virtual Reality (VR) applications allow a user to explore a scene intuitively through a tracked head-mounted display (HMD). However, in complex scenes, occlusions make scene exploration inefficient, as the user has to navigate around occluders to gain line of sight to potential regions of interest. When a scene region proves to be of no interest, the user has to retrace their path, and such a sequential scene exploration implies significant amounts of wasted navigation. Furthermore, as the virtual world is typically much larger than the tracked physical space hosting the VR application, the intuitive one-to-one mapping between the virtual and real space has to be temporarily suspended for the user to teleport or redirect in order to conform to the physical space constraints. In this paper we introduce a method for improving VR exploration efficiency by automatically constructing a multiperspective visualization that removes occlusions. For each frame, the scene is first rendered conventionally, the z-buffer is analyzed to detect horizontal and vertical depth discontinuities, the discontinuities are used to define disocclusion portals which are 3D scene rectangles for routing rays around occluders, and the disocclusion portals are used to render a multiperpsective image that alleviates occlusions. The user controls the multiperspective disocclusion effect, deploying and retracting it with small head translations. We have quantified the VR exploration efficiency brought by our occlusion removal method in a study where participants searched for a stationary target, and chased a dynamic target. Our method showed an advantage over conventional VR exploration in terms of reducing the navigation distance, the view direction rotation, the number of redirections, and the task completion time. These advantages did not come at the cost of a reduction in depth perception or situational awareness, or of an increase in simulator sickness.",VR exploration;occlusion removal;disocclusion portal;multiperspective visualization,,"State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN"

Moreover, the reflection of the acoustic beam can lift eggs and larvae from the bottom of the culture dish and further manipulate them in the vertical and horizontal directions. Additionally, we present quantitative analyses of the shrimp-egg rotation frequency with respect to the focal depths, topological charges of the vortex, and excitation voltages.

Although a foot-mounted inertial navigation system (Foot-INS) can acquire pedestrian trajectories in multistory buildings, it will inevitably encounter heading divergence because the constraint information is not always valid. Therefore, we proposed an accurate and convenient postprocessing indoor pedestrian positioning system (IPPS) to acquire pedestrian trajectories in multistory buildings such as shopping malls. Based on the hypotheses that the start and end points of the pedestrian trajectories on a single floor were closed, and the horizontal position of the closing point on each floor was identical. Therefore, in the single floor of multistory buildings, we use the closing point to control the trajectory drift error caused by the Foot-INS, and use a smoothing algorithm to reasonably distribute the drift error to the entire trajectory. Heading divergence is unavoidable with the Foot-INS, result in the pedestrian trajectories acquired on different floors were rotationally offset. Because pedestrian trajectories can epitomize the building orientation and provide an opportunity to align those trajectories on multistory buildings, an algorithm was proposed to match the trajectories acquired on different floors. A hybrid simulation experiment was conducted using an accurate reference object to evaluate the positioning performance of the proposed IPPS. The effectiveness of acquiring pedestrian trajectories was also confirmed by various experimental tests in a large shopping mall. The study findings suggest that the proposed IPPS is self-contained, low cost, and has the potential for large-scale applications.",Foot-mounted inertial navigation system (Foot-INS);indoor pedestrian positioning system (IPPS);multistory building;trajectory matching,,"GNSS Research Center and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; GNSS Research Center and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; GNSS Research Center and the Artificial Intelligence Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"

Hua,2019,IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,IEEE Journals,4,"The dynamic behavior of an arc plasma involves the complex heat and mass transfer process in the arc welding process, especially for pulsed gas metal arc welding (P-GMAW). The spectral diagnostics of the arc plasma is essential to both the validation of simulation results and the monitoring and control of the arc welding process. In this article, we studied the dynamic behavior and spatial spectral characteristics of the welding arc during the pulsed gas metal arc welding of the AA5083 aluminum alloy with an ER5183 wire using a high-speed camera and spectrometer. Based on the acquired spectra at different time points of the pulse, we calculated the plasma characteristics using the spectral lines emitted from the shielding gas and the metal vapor. The variation and spectral diagnosis of the arc indicated that the bright region was mainly caused by radiation from the metal vapor, which easily increased at the peak current. The measured arc temperature and electron density were elevated along with the welding current. Moreover, the ratio of metal vapor in the arc plasma also increased due to strengthened evaporation from the electrode. Along the horizontal axis, the arc temperature increased and reached a maximum in the central part of the arc. There was a potential local minimum near the electrode as the current increased.

Zhan,2021,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,IEEE Journals,4,"Due to the complexity of geological structures, it is difficult to fully characterize unconventional oil and gas reservoirs in the existing geological exploitation theories and techniques. This article introduced a laser induced plasma transmission voltage (LIPTV) method for characterizing the isotropy of sandstone and anisotropy of shale. When the rocks receive a nanosecond pulsed laser, plasma is generated on the sample surface. Under the condition of applied electric field, the maximum voltage of 0.024 V can be obtained. Plasma transport was related to surface morphology and structure. The mechanism of plasma transport on the surface can be analyzed by simulating the voltage attenuation process with time. Rotation angle-dependent voltage peaks of shale presented a symmetry at the location of 180° and was an oval in polar graph, where the long shaft and the short shaft were parallel and perpendicular to bedding direction, respectively (relative range = 150%). According to the relation between the double-exponential fitting tendency and the attenuation waveform, electric field controls the transport of the carrier in the horizontal and vertical directions in shale. For sandstone, a circle was obtained in polar graph because of the isotropy (relative range = 28%). Therefore, the direction characterization supported by LIPTV method is helpful for enhancing oil recovery in petroleum industry.",Anisotropy;laser-induced voltage (LIV);plasma;sandstone;shale,,"State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; College of Geophysics, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China"

The state of the art in diagnosis is the clinical interview that is time intensive for the clinicians and does not take into account any objective measures of behavior. We herewith propose an empirical approach that can potentially support diagnosis based on the assessment of nonverbal behavior in avatar-mediated interactions in virtual environments. In a first study, ASD individuals and a typically developed control group were interacting in dyads. Head motion, and eye gaze of both interlocutors were recorded, replicated to the avatars and displayed to the partner through a distributed virtual environment. The nonverbal behavior of both interaction partners was recorded, and resulting preprocessed data was classified with up to 92.9parcent classification accuracy, with the amount of eye area focus and the average horizontal gaze change being the most relevant features.

However conventional track measurement for high-speed railway mainly considered the situation in the stages of design and construction which has several problems including long retest period, high labor cost, and low measurement efficiency. It cannot fully meet the requirements of rapid detection for large-scale high-speed railway tracks in the stages of operation and maintenance, especially in China. To this end, a novel high-speed railway track integrated inspection solution based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) / inertial navigation system (INS) and multisensor is proposed, and the corresponding track integrated inspection system is developed. It has been applied to the several actual track fine adjustment engineering projects for high-speed railway, and the results show that the proposed system realized the integration of the track subgrade deformation monitoring and the track geometric status absolute measurement and relative measurement for high-speed railway, and it has the lateral deviation accuracy of 2 mm and vertical deviation accuracy of 2 mm for track irregularity measurement in good consistency with the conventional track irregularity inspecting instrument (i.e., Amberg GRP1000) coupled with level at the faster average detection speed of 1 km/h, and the horizontal accuracy of 1 mm and the vertical accuracy of 1.5 mm for track subgrade deformation monitoring in real time, which fully satisfy the specific requirements for the Code for Engineering Survey of High Speed Railway, and significantly improve the detection efficiency while ensuring the measurement accuracy.

We demonstrate that continuous interaction is also possible, and is as effective on the fingers as in the off-finger space between the index finger and thumb.

Mission planners determined the project needed to develop a system that would enable the operations team to analyze engineering and science data, make science decisions, select viable rover targets at a millimeter resolution and validate an uplink bundle for a car sized rover with more complex science instruments than any previous Mars surface mission. All this had to be done within a five-hour time frame. Doing this with a small team would be a challenge, but this had to be accomplished by a large team of engineers and scientists located across North America and Europe. Achieving this level of operational efficiency was unheard of in the prime mission. In addition, the mission had another set of requirements that had nothing to do with surface operations; the Mars 2020 Ground Data System (GDS) was also expected to comply with a new set of security requirements to keep up with the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. The Mars 2020 Ground Data System (GDS) is a re-architected version of the Mars Science Laboratory GDS. The primary goal was to integrate the lessons learned from previous Mars surface missions, accommodate a set of new requirements and capabilities required to ensure mission success, and comply with a new set of cybersecurity controls. The new architecture includes several unique qualities including a data lake, language-agnostic system-wide event-based operations, containerization, automated deployment, network segmentation, infrastructure-as-code, API-driven interfaces, and the first Mars surface GDS to operate primarily in the cloud. The new architecture enabled greater access to the system's data, tighter integration with the operations team, and a higher level of traceability. The availability of the data also enabled a new set of capabilities previously not possible on surface missions. These new capabilities include an autonomous data to information, pipeline for downlink analysis, horizontal scaling of science data processing capabilities, autonomous round trip data tracking of science and engineering data, integration of flight system state into the tactical planning cycle, high fidelity targeting utilizing kinematic data, and hierarchical image and 3d meshes data representations. This paper will introduce the requirements for the Mars 2020 Mission, the heritage architecture, and the rationale for the changes to achieve the new architecture. The paper will continue to describe the fundamental changes made to the GDS architecture, how these changes enabled a more tightly integrated GDS, and the new capabilities that were enabled by the new architecture.

Teutsch,2021,2021 IEEE 71st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),IEEE Conferences,1,"This study demonstrates laser assisted bonding (LAB) of SMD Tantal Elko and MLCC (Multilayer Ceramic Chip Capacitor) capacitors and presents a comparison to conventional bonding using solder paste and reflow oven. The LAB technique, unique to Pac Tech, has greatly improved ensuing properties of packages over conventional oven reflow processes. As the LAB process is temperature controlled, it allows for a non-destructive yet fast and minimally invasive reflow of the bond-layer (solder). While the LAB process was demonstrated previously in terms of a wide range of applications, its feasibility and advantages have not yet been assessed for the stacking of passive SMD elements such as capacitors or resistors [1]-[3] and [4]. In this study, the 3D stacking possibilities of SMD capacitors will be evaluated. This technique allows the vertical or horizontal arrangement of the SMD elements on top of each other. The overall footprint of a given device such as a capacitor can be reduced, as it can be replaced by a stack of two or more smaller devices. To evaluate the potential of the LAB process, several sizes of SMD capacitors (3216M, 2012M and 1005M) were bonded and stacked. A parametric study was performed to evaluate suitable process windows for a given number of samples. To analyze test assemblies, several techniques were employed such as microscopic inspection, electrical qualification, 3D surface scans, shear-test and cross-sectional analysis. The robustness of the assemblies was investigated via a vibration test. Specifically, the mechanical properties of the devices were simulated through several cycles of high frequency vibration tests relative to three-dimensional loads.

2404,Optical Interferometric Force Sensor Based on a Buckled Beam,Y. Tang; J. Guo; Y. Chen; J. Huang,2022,IEEE Sensors Journal,IEEE Journals,1,"This paper reports a novel extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI)-based fiber optic sensor for force measurement. The prototype force sensor consists of two EFPIs mounted on a stainless steel rectangular frame. The primary sensing element, i.e., the first EFPI, is formed between the endface of a horizontally-placed optical fiber and a stainless steel buckled beam. The second EFPI, fashioned between a longitudinally-placed optical fiber and a silver-coated glass beam, is arranged to demonstrate the amplification mechanism of the buckled beam structure. When the sensor is subjected to a tension force, the pre-buckled beam will deflect backward, resulting in a longitudinal/axial displacement of the pre-buckled beam. The axial displacement is further transferred and amplified to a horizontal/vertical deflection at the middle of the buckled beam, leading to a relatively-significant change in the Fabry-Perot cavity length. A force sensitivity of 796 nm/ ${N}$  (change in cavity length/Newton) is achieved with a low-temperature dependence of  $0.005 {N}$ /°C. The stability of the sensor is also investigated with a standard deviation of ± 5 nm, corresponding to a measurement resolution of ±0.0064 N. A simulation is conducted to study the axial displacement and stress distribution of the sensor when it is subjected to a tension load of 250 N. It is demonstrated that the maximum stress of the sensor is tremendously reduced attributed to the buckled design, enabling a long service life cycle of the force sensor.

However, the geometric positioning accuracy of optical satellites, which is the most common data source, is generally insufficient. An intuitive idea to improve accuracy is to integrate the dominant accuracy of multisource information. Previous articles have used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and geoscience laser altimetry system (GLAS) data with improved geopositioning accuracy. However, the accuracy and applicability of existing combination methods are unsatisfactory because of various restrictions. In this article, a pipeline with automatic extraction of tie points and combined adjustment was designed based on nonstereo SAR images and GLAS data, considering both the high precision and wide distribution of multisource data. Experiments using real satellite data (ZY-3, GF-7, GF-3, and ICESat-2) and test areas covering complex landforms demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed pipeline.

The antenna meets the multiangle radiation requirements of the antenna for flexible positioning of IoT devices and conforms to the concept of green Internet basic hardware, with low energy and small size. In our design, three parasitic elements will couple with the higher order modes through the slot-hole excitation of a higher order mode dielectric resonator antenna with a dielectric constant of 10. By controlling the distance between the three parasitic elements and changing the capacitor at their terminals, radiation variation in multiple directions can be achieved. The proposed model focuses on the relationships among the three element distances and the effect of the third parasitic element on the radiation angle. Good results were obtained for gain, bandwidth, and radiation angle. Through simulation, the dielectric resonator antenna works successfully in the 15-GHz frequency band. Thus, the antenna array can be from −34° to 34° in the horizontal direction and from 0° to −36° in the vertical direction. At the same time, the gains are kept at a good level and the bandwidths are greater than 2 GHz.

The aim of the present research was to investigate, for tablet computer users, the writing speed, tracing accuracy, comfort perception, and satisfaction in terms of five angles formed by the use of an external peripheral. In two kinds of tasks (writing and tracing lines), a control experimental design with various tilt angles (5°, 15°, 25°, 35° and 45° from horizontal) was adopted. The efficiency of writing tasks and the accuracy of line tracing were calculated following each incline. Using the five-point Likert Scale, the tablet computer users’ perceived comfort and ease of use were also evaluated. The results reveal that when tablet personal computers (Tablet PCs) were mounted at a high tilt angle (35°), the writing speed was high (P = 0.028). Meanwhile, when the tablet computer was mounted at a low tilt angle (5°), user comfort and satisfaction were high (P < 0.001). The findings of the present article suggest that users who need to write or draw for short periods increase the angle (approximate 35°) of their Tablet PC to improve their writing speed. Conversely, users who need long periods of use could position the Tablet PC at a lower tilt angle (approximate 5°) to reduce the risk of any musculoskeletal disorder.",Tablet computers;human factors;writing efficiency;subjective preference,,"School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Design, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"

These approaches, which we call Industrial Vision, are expected to offer customized solutions for intelligent manufacturing in an accurate, time efficient and robust manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to industrial vision, called Edge-Eye, to rectify the edge deviation automatically for Irradiated Cross-linked Polyethylene Foam (IXPE) production with millimeter-level accuracy. IXPE has been one of the most commonly used materials in industry. During the production process of IXPE sheets, their edges need keep aligned strictly, otherwise, they could quickly get out of the border of the rolling plate and cause the huge economic loss. We deploy a commercial camera with mobile edge node in front of the IXPE sheet to continuously detect and rectify the edge deviation. Particularly, to handle the complex production environment when extracting the edge of IXPE sheet, we deploy a pair of reference bars with high-contrast colors to efficiently differentiate the sheet edge from the background. Then, we propose a Bi-direction Edge Tracking method to perform the edge detection from both vertical and horizontal aspects. To realize the rectification using mobile edge nodes with limited computing resources, we reduce the cost of computation by extracting the Minimized Region of Interest, i.e., the edge area overlapped with the higher contrast reference bar on both sides. We further design a negative feedback control system with multi-stage feedback regulation mechanism, keeping the edge deviation within millimeter-level. We implemented Edge-Eye on the ARM64 platform and performed evaluation in the practical IXPE production process. The experimental results show that Edge-Eye achieves the average accuracy of 5 mm for the edge deviation rectification, with the average latency of 200 ms for edge deviation detection. During the process of 20-month real deployment for 36 production lines, 66 manpower per day (90% of the overall manpower) has been saved, and the utilization rate of IXPE material increases from 87% to 94%.",Edge computing;edge deviation rectification;industial Internet of Things;industrial vision,,"State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China; School of Computing, Macquarie University, Australia; College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"

Ball,2023,IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation,IEEE Journals,0,"This paper presents a millimeter wave series-fed microstrip line antenna array with low side lobes. For millimeter-wave beam forming applications, compact series fed arrays with very small horizontal width and low side lobes are very much required. The proposed array consists of a microstrip line with periodically placed stepped inverted-cone stub sections at a guided wavelength spacing. Surface current cancellation at each guided wavelength in an ideal microstrip line can be altered by symmetrically introducing the inverted-cone stub sections on two edges with a half wavelength offset. By controlling the dimensions and location of the inverted-cone stub sections, the equivalent surface currents can be altered and focused on the cone stub sections, resulting in an effective array radiation. The fabricated antenna array is resonating at 28 GHz and has an impedance bandwidth of 1.3 GHz. Peak realized gain of 10.2 dBi is achieved at 28 GHz and the measured side lobe levels are better than −15 dB in the E and H plane. The proposed microstrip line antenna array with low side lobes also benefits from simple fabrication and high integration ability, which makes it attractive for compact beamforming scenarios in millimeter-wave bands.",Antennas;antenna array;low sidelobe level (SLL);millimeter-wave (mm-wave) array;series-fed array;transmission lines,,"Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K; Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K"

Hillers,2022,"OCEANS 2022, Hampton Roads",IEEE Conferences,0,"Black Carbon (BC) is part of soot and one of the primary ship emissions. Several studies have shown that BC has an impact on global warming and that it is harmful to health so there is the necessity for regional and global regulations of BC. To investigate ship emissions and pollution in the atmosphere and in waters, sensors and measurement platforms are being developed in the MarTERA ERA-NET Cofund funded project MATE (MAritime Traffic Emissions: A monitoring network). One of these measurement platforms is a remotelY towed operateD vehicle (YDE-Fix) for coastal and open sea areas. YDE-Fix is equipped with oceanographic sensors to measure the main in-situ parameters like temperature, turbidity and oxygen as well as dBC, dissolved Black Carbon. A special feature in the design is a flow through tube were sensors which react sensitive to ambient light can be attached. The shape of YDE-Fix is designed by using the Myring-hull-profile equations and engineered as small as possible to create low drag forces in the water. YDE-Fix is equipped with eight fins, four stern fins which can be remotely controlled. Thus it is possible that the towing vehicle can ascend and descend and an undulating movement is possible to measure in different water depths up to 20 m. In addition, the four central fins have a fixed pre-set inclination. The two horizontal central fins generate always a downward force against the towing rope. Another benefit of YDE-Fix is the rotating bearing-mounted slip ring for the towing cable to prevent an additional rolling during operation due to the towing force. To ensure that the hull shape and design of the towed body behaves as planned, a prototype has been built at a scale of 1:3. The scaled model was also simulated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics, simulation program) to get a better prediction of its drag and lift forces at dynamic inflow velocities. The scaled model was successfully tested in a towing tank to validate the simulation results as well as the drag estimations by ITTC’57. The evaluation shows that the results of the CFD simulation agree well with the measured drag forces of the towing tank tests. This confirmed and thus validated the CFD simulation results in the towing tank in a reproducible manner.",remotely towed vehicle;CFD analyses;towing tank;hybrid modelling;black carbon,,"Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment, University of Oldenburg, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment, University of Oldenburg, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Department of Engineering Sciences, Jade University of Applied Sciences, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Department of Engineering Sciences, Jade University of Applied Sciences, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, City University of Applied Sciences, Bremen, Germany; Fraunhofer Working Group Sustainable Maritime Mobility, University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Leer, Germany; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, City University of Applied Sciences, Bremen, Germany; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, City University of Applied Sciences, Bremen, Germany; Fraunhofer Working Group Sustainable Maritime Mobility, University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Leer, Germany"

The impacts of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS communications on the block error rate (BLER) and throughput of the system are presented via the Rician factor. For the evaluation of system performance, we derive the closed-form and approximate expressions of the BLERs of each hop and the end-to-end communication path between source and destination. Based on these derived BLER expressions, we calculate the throughput of the considered UAV-NOMA-short packet communication (SPC) system. Analytical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that the best system performance can be achieved by selecting a reasonable time switching duration for energy harvesting, blocklength, and the number of training bits. The minimal BLERs can be obtained by controlling the trajectory of the UAV, i.e., its altitude and location on the horizontal plane. The BLER performance of the UAV-NOMA-SPC system is compared with that of the UAV-orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-SPC system, showing that the UAV-NOMA-SPC gives a lower average BLERs than the UAV-OMA-SPC system.",Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);energy harvesting;successive interference cancellation (SIC);block error rate (BLER);throughput,,"Faculty of Telecommunications Services, Telecommunications University, Nha Trang, Vietnam; Faculty of Computing Fundamentals, FPT University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Faculty of Basic Techniques, Telecommunications University, Nha Trang, Vietnam; Department of Artificial Intelligence, FPT University, Hanoi, Vietnam; Research Institute for Computer and Information Communication, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea"

Heimann; F. Grigoli; S. von Specht; C. Hammer; A. Zang; T. Dahm,2020,Geophysical Journal International,OUP Journals,0,"Understanding fracturing processes and the hydromechanical relation to induced seismicity is a key question for enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Commonly massive fluid injection, predominately causing hydroshearing, are used in large-scale EGS but also hydraulic fracturing approaches were discussed. To evaluate the applicability of hydraulic fracturing techniques in EGS, six in situ, multistage hydraulic fracturing experiments with three different injection schemes were performed under controlled conditions in crystalline rock at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden). During the experiments the near-field ground motion was continuously recorded by 11 piezoelectric borehole sensors with a sampling rate of 1 MHz. The sensor network covered a volume of 30×30×30 m around a horizontal, 28-m-long injection borehole at a depth of 410 m. To extract and characterize massive, induced, high-frequency acoustic emission (AE) activity from continuous recordings, a semi-automated workflow was developed relying on full waveform based detection, classification and location procedures. The approach extended the AE catalogue from 196 triggered events in previous studies to more than 19 600 located AEs. The enhanced catalogue, for the first time, allows a detailed analysis of induced seismicity during single hydraulic fracturing experiments, including the individual fracturing stages and the comparison between injection schemes. Beside the detailed study of the spatio-temporal patterns, event clusters and the growth of seismic clouds, we estimate relative magnitudes and b-values of AEs for conventional, cyclic progressive and dynamic pulse injection schemes, the latter two being fatigue hydraulic fracturing techniques. While the conventional fracturing leads to AE patterns clustered in planar regions, indicating the generation of a single main fracture plane, the cyclic progressive injection scheme results in a more diffuse, cloud-like AE distribution, indicating the activation of a more complex fracture network. For a given amount of hydraulic energy (pressure multiplied by injected volume) pumped into the system, the cyclic progressive scheme is characterized by a lower rate of seismicity, lower maximum magnitudes and significantly larger b-values, implying an increased number of small events relative to the large ones. To our knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of high resolution seismicity in a mine-scale experiment induced by different hydraulic fracturing schemes.",Fracture and flow;Spatial analysis;Statistical methods;Time-series analysis;Induced seismicity,,"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; Institute of Geosciences, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; pniemz@gfz-potsdam.de; GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; Swiss Seismological Service, ETH-Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; Earthquake-Disaster & Risk Evaluation and Management (E-DREaM) Center, National Central University, Taiwan; Swiss Seismological Service, ETH-Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; Institute of Geosciences, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany; Institute of Geosciences, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"

In the deep sea with a complicated exploration environment, collaboration between heterogeneous AMVs can maximize exploration efficiency by utilizing various functional benefits. Accordingly, the paper proposes a method for collaborative path planning for heterogeneous AMVs that employs a fused metaheuristic algorithm for the underwater path planning of an autonomous underwater glider (AUG), and an adaptive surface path planning of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), respectively. The fused metaheuristic method balances global and local path explorations for underwater path planning by integrating the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and equilibrium optimizer (EO), and it reduces the local optimum problem by using a conditional convergence factor; and the adaptive surface path planning approach considers the influence of ocean currents at various locations to guide the ASV collaboratively to track the AUG underwater in the horizontal plane.

As we have transitioned from desktop crowdsourcing applications (e.g., Wikipedia) to SC applications (e.g., Uber), there is a sense that SC systems must not only provide effective task assignment but also need to ensure privacy. To achieve these often-conflicting objectives, we propose a framework, Task Assignment with Federated Preference Learning, that performs task assignment based on worker preferences while keeping the data decentralized and private in each platform center (e.g., each delivery center of an SC company). The framework includes a federated preference learning phase and a task assignment phase. Specifically, in the first phase, we build a local preference model for each platform center based on historical data. We provide means of horizontal federated learning that makes it possible to collaboratively train these local preference models under the orchestration of a central server. Specifically, we provide a practical method that accelerates federated preference learning based on stochastic controlled averaging and achieves low communication costs while considering data heterogeneity among clients.

This paper takes the cooperation system composed of the QUAV and the mobile ground vehicle as the research object, and conducts in-depth research on the tracking and landing of the QUAV on the mobile ground vehicle. For the tracking and landing of the QUAV in the actual environment, two difficult problems that are easy to appear are mainly discussed: when the mobile ground vehicle has acceleration, the QUAV is easy to loss the target due to the strong maneuverability of the ground vehicle; when the mobile ground vehicle moves on non-horizontal roads, changes of the slope will also affect the tracking and landing of the QUAV. In response to the above two problems, the method of ground-air information fusion is adopted. The sensor information of the ground vehicle is used to reflect the movement and driving conditions of the mobile ground vehicle. And then combined with the current visual tracking status of the QUAV to achieve information adaptive fusion and reasonably adjust the control amount of the QUAV.

Green,2021,2021 36th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ),IEEE Conferences,0,"Facial tics are abrupt and involuntary facial movements that are typically expressed for less than one second. This paper proposes a method to autonomously detect facial tics in video recordings to help medical professionals diagnose and monitor tic disorders in patients.Faces are detected in the video feed using a set of Histogram of Oriented Gradients filters and a linear Support Vector Machine. Facial movements are monitored by tracking the area and the horizontal and vertical coordinates of each of the patient’s facial features. Facial features are detected by calculating the convex hulls of points on the face known as facial landmarks. Facial landmark detection is implemented using a cascade of regressor functions that are trained to find the positions of 68 facial landmarks. The coordinates and area of each facial feature are analysed in separate data streams. When the value of a point in a data stream differs significantly from the average value of the surrounding points, a significant movement is detected. Short duration significant movements are labelled as facial tics. Long duration significant movements are labelled as long duration movements.The proposed method was able to achieve 90% accuracy in controlled conditions. 66% of long duration significant movements were incorrectly labelled as facial tics, giving a 66% false positive rate. The proposed method improves on past research by analysing multiple facial features and by providing graphical information on the characteristics of each facial movement.",facial tics;facial feature detection;facial movement detection,,"Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"

Here, we investigate how to construct reaching movements across different directions and distances by altering the recruitment of a few muscle synergies. To this end, electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from nine upper limb muscles during reaching movements across six directions and three distances in the horizontal plane. Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was employed to extract muscle synergies. For each one of eleven subjects, three muscle synergies could account for a large fraction (88.85±1.68%) of variations in EMG signals across all conditions. By characterizing the activation of synergies in each direction and distance, we found that two synergies only activated in specific directions, and positive correlations existed between their activation levels and distance in these directions. However, the remaining synergy was almost activated with the same degree in all directions and distances. Overall, our results demonstrate that the control of a repertoire of reaching movements can be achieved by flexibly modulating the activation of several muscle synergies.",,,"Sensor Network and Application Research Center, School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Sensor Network and Application Research Center, School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Sensor Network and Application Research Center, School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Sensor Network and Application Research Center, School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Sensor Network and Application Research Center, School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"

2424,Influence of Bevel Section on Flow Characteristics of Double Serpentine Nozzle with Bevel,L. Jiao; L. Zhou; Z. Wang; J. Shi,2023,2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference,IEEE Conferences,0,"In order to improve fighters' stealth ability and reach an integrated design of the outer fuselage and nozzle, a double serpentine nozzle can be scarfed at the tail according to the aircraft's skin. But the jet flow of the exhaust system is deflected when a nozzle is beveled, which makes the thrust line not completely coincide with the aircraft axis. Different degrees of thrust line cause corresponding deflection torque, which affects the aerodynamics layout of the aircraft and causes difficulties in aircraft control. In this paper, a double serpentine nozzle with bevel which consists of a first bend section, second bend section, and bevel section is taken as the baseline to study the influence of geometric parameters of the double serpentine nozzle with bevel on flow characteristics. Two parameters of the bevel section, angle, and length, were selected to research. Seven nozzles with different deflection angles of the bevel section were numerically simulated. Results show that the aerodynamic parameters of those nozzles are slightly different. The thrust line deflects in the same direction as the changed deflection direction of the bevel section, but the deflection amplitude of the thrust line is significantly smaller than the deflection amplitude of the bevel section. And when deflecting one direction (Y/Z) actively, the other direction (Z/Y) will have the opposite effect. The change of the bevel section deflection angle has a greater impact on the thrust line. Six nozzles with different lengths of the bevel section were selected. Numerical results show that as the length increases, the friction resistance of nozzles increases, and the loss increases. With the increase in the length of the bevel section, the angle between the thrust line and the vertical plane XY is gradually decreasing, so the thrust line deflects close to the bevel section axis. For the angle with the horizontal plane XZ, the thrust line deflects upward when the bevel section lengthens by 7%; then when the length of the bevel section continues to increase, the thrust line deflects downward. The average angle variation in each direction is about 0.1° when the length increases by 7%. In this paper, four flight conditions including subsonic and, supersonic jet conditions are studied. Flight conditions heavily influence the thrust line of the double serpentine nozzle with bevel.",,,"School of Power and Energy, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, CN; School of Power and Energy, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, CN; School of Power and Energy, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, CN; School of Power and Energy, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, CN"

Multiple solutions have been proposed in recent years, using time-frequency representations to identify either horizontal and vertical structures or orientations and anisotropy in the spectrogram of the sound. In this paper, we present SiTraNo: an easy-to-use MATLAB application with a graphic user interface for audio decomposition that enables visualization and access to the sinusoidal, transient, and noise classes, individually. This application allows the user to choose between different well-known separation methods to analyze an input sound file, to instantaneously control and remix its spectral components, and to visually check the quality of the separation, before producing the desired output file. The visualization of common artifacts, such as birdies and dropouts, is demonstrated. This application promotes experimenting with the sound decomposition process by observing the effect of variations for each spectral component on the original sound and by comparing different methods against each other, evaluating the separation quality both audibly and visually.

Pan,2020,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,15,"The development of mobile communication sets higher demands on high frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. The layout of interdigital transducers (IDT) in SAW devices is in plane and the traditional methods of improving frequency for SAW devices are the increase of acoustic velocity and the reduction of wavelength. However, these methods have a limit due to the limited acoustic velocity and the photolithography limit. This work proposes a new way for the development of high frequency SAW devices by redesigning the layout of IDT in three dimensions (3D). The set of IDTs is split into two layers, i.e. the ground electrodes on one layer and the signal electrodes on the other layer. This 3D layout of IDTs dramatically narrows the horizontal gap between two adjacent electrodes, which can significantly increase the frequency. The frequency and the electromechanical coupling factor (K2) of the four structures of SAW devices with the 3D layout of IDTs were studied by the finite element method (FEM). The results show that the frequency can be doubled under the same critical resolution of lithography due to the shortening of wavelength, and the 3D layout of IDTs is available for SAW devices based on piezoelectric thin film or piezoelectric single crystal.

2432,Directional Transmission Characteristics of Acoustic Waves Based on Artificial Periodic Structures,S. Tang; R. Wang; J. Han,2019,IEEE Access,IEEE Journals,3,"Acoustic artificial periodic structures, also known as phononic crystal, have been widely used in special acoustic problems such as low-frequency vibration reduction and noise reduction due to their bandgap characteristics. Different from previous researches, which focus on the bandgap characteristics, we designed a locally resonant artificial periodic structure, which can not only use the bandgap characteristics to design a directional transmission channel of acoustic waves, but also use its bandpass characteristics to generate multidirectional transmission of acoustic waves. The vibration mechanism of two-dimensional, three-components phononic crystal lattice structures was given, and a variety of directional transmission models of acoustic waves were constructed based on the unit cell. The simulation results showed that acoustic directional transmission characteristics were produced by the locally periodic resonance structure, and the transmission direction depends on the design of the structure. By taking advantage of the superposition properties of acoustic waves, the incident acoustic wave in the horizontal direction can be converted into the outgoing acoustic wave in the vertical direction without changing the position of the model, and this capability greatly expands the application range of the artificial periodic structure. In addition, the transmission characteristics of the directional transmission effect have a strong correlation with the frequency; that is, limited by the wavelength, the acoustic pressure distribution mode at different frequencies will be different. At the resonant frequency of the structure, the transmission efficiency of the acoustic wave will be highest. Moreover, similar to the traditional artificial periodic structure, the acoustic model proposed in this paper also has bandgap characteristics. Using bandgap characteristics, we designed an acoustic directional transmission channel to achieve uniform directional transmission of acoustic waves. These results greatly enrich the application space of artificial acoustic structures and provide new ideas for acoustic communication, acoustic detection, and acoustic stealth.",Metamaterial;local resonance;artificial structures;phononic crystals,,"School of Science, North University of China, Taiyuan, China; School of Science, North University of China, Taiyuan, China; School of Information and Communication Engineering, North University of China, Taiyuan, China"

This study aims to assess the plantar fascia (PF) quantitatively by using feature descriptors and seek valuable imaging biomarkers that can reliably diagnose PFis. A total of 63 participants underwent B-mode and longitudinal shear wave elastography (SWE) on unilateral plantar fasciae. To characterize the statistical and spatial texture features of the PF, ten statistical descriptors of the shear modulus in the standardized region of interest in PF and twenty texture descriptors in the SWE measurement window (in both horizontal and vertical directions) are proposed. Four statistical quantities (mode, avg, med, qG) and four texture descriptors (autoc, sosvh, savgh svarh) showed potential for diagnosing PFis, based on significant differences between the PFis and the healthy groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the statistical descriptors have area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 0.9 (likelihood ratio >6.798) and the texture descriptors have AUC of approximately 0.85 (likelihood ratio >3.195). Combinations of statistical and texture descriptors can achieve higher AUCs ~0.968. In addition, these descriptors were related to the clinical indices (body mass index and visual analogue scale) with Spearman's correlation coefficient of r=-0.5~ -0.4(p <; 0.05).

Nilsson,2023,IEEE Control Systems Magazine,IEEE Magazines,0,"Autonomous snake robot locomotion in rough terrain depends on the robot’s ability to rise from a horizontal position to a vertical, for its ability to climb obstacles. At first sight, lifting N body segments seems to require O(N 2)dynamic torque. However, in this article we describe a practical algorithm that requires only O(1) dynamic torque. The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of snake robot morphologies. The algorithm requires little space, and control is simple, since motion occurs only in a plane. Analysis of the algorithm reveals a strong relation between the maximum dynamic torque required and the joint pitch range. We discuss some consequences for the design of snake robots. For instance, an adjustment of the mass center of the robot’s end segment can reduce the maximum dynamic torque. Implications are studied for some snake robot joint designs, including Dragon, an autonomous snake robot constructed for the study of unconventional locomotion.",,,

Small-size Stewart platform was built and used for demonstrating the application of the controller. HD web camera was the visual sensor for sensing the ball position. After image processing, by using color threshold and object detection, the ball position was a feedback signal of the controller. In ball balancing control problem, the x-direction and y-direction can be decentralized and are separated into two PID control loops. Conventional PID control might give poor performance due to nonlinearity such as friction and error from the visual tracking. Model-based control design is complicated and could be suffered from modeling uncertainties. Fuzzy controller, which is a nonlinear control, is chosen to resolve the problem. By the way, the PID controller can be enhanced by using a fuzzy supervisory system. By using a few human intuitive rules, from ball speed and ball location, control performance can be improved. Each PID controller gains were adjusted by the fuzzy supervisor. The controller generated the pitch and roll references.

It is a platform to test and identify different aspects of controls, as the non-linearities increases with the degree of freedoms. So far many techniques have been applied to sense the position of the ball on a plate in real time, most common of them is touchpad and audio video camera system. This paper describes the design, development and control strategy of balancing a ball on a plate using low cost phototransistor sensors. These Phototransistors are triggered by monochromatic sharp beams of laser light. The plate area is 1sq. foot and an array of 11 sensors each 1 inch apart is used on each axis making total of 121 points on the plate. To balance the ball, two motors are used one for each axis. The ground motor is fixed, while to control the other axis second motor is fixed on top of the ground motor. Hence the system utilizes two sets of independent control mechanisms, each operating in isolation for each axis. ATMEGA16 microcontroller is used which is an Atmel AVR family controller with a flash memory of 16 kb. Since it has two independently switched PWM channels, therefore, it makes this controller ideal for the purpose. Dynamic modeling of the system yields the digital controller capable of balancing the ball in any of the desired positions out of 121 points, on the plate.

The data errors obtained by the inertial devices will accumulate over time, and the long-term pose estimation is rather unreliable. But for some quick motion over a short period of time, inertial sensors can get very accurate estimates. Monocular cameras are often used as image real-time monitoring sensors by single ball self-balancing mobile robots. The camera's data does not accumulate errors over time, so there is essentially no drift. Therefore, camera pose estimation can effectively correct the inertial sensor error.

So that the robot makes a wrong estimate. In this paper, the non-linear optimization method is used to fuse the IMU and monocular attitude data to obtain the optimal pose estimation of the robot.

Bhagat,2023,"2023 International Conference on Power, Instrumentation, Control and Computing (PICC)",IEEE Conferences,0,"This paper is intended for control and stabilization of the Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) system wherein a magnetic ball is levitated in space under the influence of a magnetic field. The Maglev system, which is highly unstable in nature, is made to stabilize with use of a PID controller in feedback. The values of gains of the PID controller can be found after applying metaheuristic algorithms. In this study, the Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) has been employed to determine the gains of the PID controller. HBA is a recently developed algorithm that offers a good balance of speed of convergence and exploration and exploitation. Various time domain parameters like Settling time, Peak time, Rise time, and Maximum Overshoot are computed and compared with differently tuned PID gain values using various algorithms. The results obtained after applying HBA are compared to those of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to validate the efficacy of the applied algorithm.",Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Controller;Magnetic Levitation System (MLS);Genetic Algorithm (GA);Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO,,"Electrical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India; Electrical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India; Electrical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"

This paper proposes a design method of PID control based on the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma for the ball and plate. The design method has two features: the first one is that a structure of the controller is called I-PD to suppress a large input signal against a major change of the reference signal; the second one is that a filter is introduced into the feedback loop to reduce an influence of the noise measurement from the camera. Both simulation and experiment evaluate the effectiveness of the design method.",,,"Graduate School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan; Department of Science and Engineering, Meiji University, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"

Bhushan,2020,2020 International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC),IEEE Conferences,4,"Magnetic levitation system is a second-order nonlinear system. The objective of the system is to levitate a metallic ball at a determined height under the influence of magnetic force by the principle of non-contact. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to develop a controller to regulate the nonlinear dynamics in the magnetic levitation system. The proposed technique acts in parallel with a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller to balance the position of levitating ball in the air. Here, the optimization technique tunes the gain values of the PID controller for achieving better performance measures when applied to a nonlinear system. This tuning process adheres to search the optimal solution with the help of agents called as particles whose trajectories are adjusted by a deterministic component. Each particle is optimized by its best-achieved position through the iterative approach. Further, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through simulation as well as on hardware. Both PID and PSO tuned PID controllers were designed and the dynamics of magnetic levitation system were tested. The results validate the performance of both conventional PID controller as well as PSO tuned PID controller enhancing the operation of the magnetic levitation system. It is observed that the PSO tuned PID overcomes the drawback of conventional PID by optimizing the performance parameters such as steady-state error and settling time.",Particle swarm optimization (PSO);Zeigler Nicholas (Z-N) method;PID controller;Linear quadratic regulator (LQR);Magnetic levitation system (MLS),,"Electrical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India; Electrical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"

The system can be used in various transportation devices, delivery and stabilization systems and is particularly suitable for working in outdoor where the surface of ground is not flat or structured. The platform can freely rotate with the help of a ball and socket joint at its center. Lateral and longitudinal movements are controlled by two servomotors for each axis. As the cart moves on slope or on a rough terrain, the instantaneous tilt of the platform is measured by a gyroscope assembly which is compared with the desired orientation of the platform and can take corrective measure for platform up to 5 degrees in both axes. In this paper, physical modeling method is used for rapid simulation of system and mathematical relationship between platform tilt with respect to servomotor's rotation angle is developed.

Kadam,2018,2018 4th International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT),IEEE Conferences,0,"Traditional wheeled mobile robots are equipped with two independent driving wheels. Since these robots have two controllable degrees of freedom (DOFs), they can rotate about any point, but cannot perform immediate motion in every direction. To overcome this type of motion limitation, omnidirectional mobile robots were proposed. They can move in an arbitrary direction without changing the direction of the wheels, because they can achieve five DOF-motion on a two dimensional plane. A special kind of such a robot is a Ball-Balancing Robot (BBR). This system is inherently unstable, as it will immediately fall down when no active control is applied to the wheels on the ball. There is no need to rotate the robot body when change the driving direction of the ball robot, so it is suitable for cluttered environments. The proposed work is intended to be used as an assistant robot in offices, airports, shopping complexes where there is a lot of congestion in the surroundings. It is also equipped with a kinect sensor for providing vision capabilities using which it could simultaneously localize itself and map its surroundings (SLAM) that would result in a seamless motion.

It also shows how to apply the proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers to a nonlinear plant using the technique called gain scheduled control. The starting point of designing a PID controller for a nonlinear plant is to obtain a linear time invariant model through linearization around the chosen operating conditions of the system. The purpose of linearization is to find a linear function (a set of linear functions) to describe the dynamics of the nonlinear model at a given operating condition. In order to understand how the linearization is performed, the chapter examines the case of linearization of a nonlinear function. It then presents a case study based on a final year project performed by Mr John Lee. As part of the project, a prototype of a ball and plate balancing system was built and PID control systems were designed for this self‐made system.",,,

Instead of building a full humanoid robot, we start with the construction of a single leg, and analyze its kinematic and dynamic behavior. The approach is heavily based on writing various programs to solve and visualize the domains. We introduce and derive fundamental principles of the forward and inverse kinematics of a humanoid robot. The inverse kinematics are approximated using the Jacobian pseudo-inverse method. The control of the motion of a robot is introduced using the versatile PID controller. We designed two new challenge problems to motivate students with our exposition. First, a marble maze game is mounted on the leg and using their understanding of the kinematics, students implement a program to roll the ball from the start to the goal area. Secondly, we implement 1D and 2D ball balancing challenges for a ball on a plane.
