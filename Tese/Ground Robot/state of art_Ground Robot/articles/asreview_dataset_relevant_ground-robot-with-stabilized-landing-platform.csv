However, this structure has a disadvantage that needs to be avoided which is easy to vibrate. Thus, this project presents the modelling of horizontal flexible plate system using bio-inspired flower pollination algorithm. The objective is to obtain an accurate model of the real system in the simulated environment. The collected of real vibration data through experimental study was then utilized to develop the dynamic system model based on linear autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) model structure and optimized by flower pollination algorithm (FPA). The algorithm is a novel bio-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the real-life processes of the flower pollination. The gained model in this simulation is approved utilizing the most minimal mean squared error, correlation tests, and pole zero graph stability due to check the robustness of the model. The performance of the developed model was then compared with the conventional algorithm known as recursive least square (RLS).

2437,2437,Ball Balancing on a Stewart Platform using Fuzzy Supervisory PID Visual Servo Control,K. Yaovaja,2018,2018 5th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concept Theory and Applications (ICAICTA),IEEE Conferences,5,"In this paper, fuzzy supervisor of PID controller for ball balancing on a Stewart platform (ball and plate system) was implemented. Small-size Stewart platform was built and used for demonstrating the application of the controller. HD web camera was the visual sensor for sensing the ball position. After image processing, by using color threshold and object detection, the ball position was a feedback signal of the controller. In ball balancing control problem, the x-direction and y-direction can be decentralized and are separated into two PID control loops. Conventional PID control might give poor performance due to nonlinearity such as friction and error from the visual tracking. Model-based control design is complicated and could be suffered from modeling uncertainties. Fuzzy controller, which is a nonlinear control, is chosen to resolve the problem. By the way, the PID controller can be enhanced by using a fuzzy supervisory system. By using a few human intuitive rules, from ball speed and ball location, control performance can be improved. Each PID controller gains were adjusted by the fuzzy supervisor. The controller generated the pitch and roll references. The reference signals were transformed to six servo motor set-points by using the inverse kinematics of the platform. PID position controllers were used for the six servo motors. The ball position results showed enhancement by the proposed control system.",Stewart Platform,Fuzzy Supervisory Control,Ball and Plate,Robots,Machine vision,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Sriracha, Kasetsart University, Chonburi, Thailand",,1,6,,,,,

Jawad Khan,2012,Proceedings of 2012 9th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST),IEEE Conferences,20,"The ball balancing system in a 2-degree of freedom platform is of unique importance in understanding the control system applications. It is a platform to test and identify different aspects of controls, as the non-linearities increases with the degree of freedoms. So far many techniques have been applied to sense the position of the ball on a plate in real time, most common of them is touchpad and audio video camera system. This paper describes the design, development and control strategy of balancing a ball on a plate using low cost phototransistor sensors. These Phototransistors are triggered by monochromatic sharp beams of laser light. The plate area is 1sq. foot and an array of 11 sensors each 1 inch apart is used on each axis making total of 121 points on the plate. To balance the ball, two motors are used one for each axis. The ground motor is fixed, while to control the other axis second motor is fixed on top of the ground motor. Hence the system utilizes two sets of independent control mechanisms, each operating in isolation for each axis. ATMEGA16 microcontroller is used which is an Atmel AVR family controller with a flash memory of 16 kb. Since it has two independently switched PWM channels, therefore, it makes this controller ideal for the purpose. Dynamic modeling of the system yields the digital controller capable of balancing the ball in any of the desired positions out of 121 points, on the plate. Although the system becomes quite discrete but still it provides sufficient basis for implementing different control strategies and investigating different system parameters such as actuation mechanism, sensors, controller design and experimental testing, under the predefined condition of the ball diameter.",,,"Department of Mechatronics College of E& ME, National University of Sciences &Technology, Pakistan; Department of Mechatronics, Air University, Islamabad, Pakistan; Department of Mechatronics, Air University, Islamabad, Pakistan",,1,10,,,,,,,

2440,2440,Visual Servoing Based Model Reference Adaptive Control with Lyapunov Rule for a Ball on Plate Balancing System,G. Mani, N. Sivaraman, R. Kannan,2018,2018 International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced System (ICIAS),IEEE Conferences,0,"The 2 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ball balancer system is a highly nonlinear system where the position of the ball is controlled by controlling the two servo motors simultaneously. In general, conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller and Proportional Velocity (PV) is used to control the location of the ball on a plate in X and Y axes. But the major concerns are both classic PID and PV fails to track the ball position accurately due to non-linearity, process parameters variations and uncertainties. The above demerits are overcome by implementing Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) based PID controller. The closed loop reference model is chosen based on desired time domain specifications and by dominant pole placement technique. The gain values of the PID controller are tuned by MRAC to obtain optimal performance. MRAC based PID controller with MIT rule, modified MRAC with MIT approach, and modified MRAC with the Lyapunov rule are implemented in Simulink. The controller's performance on the benchmark Quanser 2 Dof ball balancer system is evaluated in real-time and comparative analysis is made. From the comparison, it is found modified MRAC based Lyapunov approach suppress the overshoot, provides better stability and tracks the system set-point accurately.

2449,2449,Pose Optimization of a Single Ball Self-Balancing Mobile Robot Based on IMU and Visual Fusion,S. Jing, Z. Ma, K. Yi, H. Li, Z. Li,2018,2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),IEEE Conferences,1,"The single ball self-balancing mobile robot is a typical multivariable, high-order, nonlinear and static instability system, IMU inertial devices are generally used to obtain attitude parameters of the system. The data errors obtained by the inertial devices will accumulate over time, and the long-term pose estimation is rather unreliable. But for some quick motion over a short period of time, inertial sensors can get very accurate estimates. Monocular cameras are often used as image real-time monitoring sensors by single ball self-balancing mobile robots. The camera's data does not accumulate errors over time, so there is essentially no drift. Therefore, camera pose estimation can effectively correct the inertial sensor error. In a fast-moving environment, the shutter-roller camera cannot capture the image clearly and there may be ghosting or overlapping of two areas too little, resulting in mismatched or unmatched conditions. So that the robot makes a wrong estimate. In this paper, the non-linear optimization method is used to fuse the IMU and monocular attitude data to obtain the optimal pose estimation of the robot. Based on the modeling of robot using Lagrange's equation method, the control of single ball robot is realized by using fuzzy PID algorithm. Experiments show that this scheme can respond quickly to the change of the attitude of the ball self-balancing robot and keep the attitude of the robot relatively stationary, so that the robot can move steadily.",Ball self-balancing robot,Attitude detection,Nonlicear optimization,Visual inertial data fusion,,"Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China; Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China; Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China",,1,18,,

640,640,Synergetic Control of the Mobile Self-Balanced Robot,S. Podvalny, E. Vasiljev,2019,2019 XXI International Conference Complex Systems: Control and Modeling Problems (CSCMP),IEEE Conferences,0,"This article is devoted to an automatic motion control of the mobile self-balanced robot installed on a two-wheeled gyroscopic platform. The traditional solution of this task is to generate the control action for the engines of the wheels that would combine the stabilization process of horizontal position of the platform and its movement along the preset trajectory. Generally, when the frequency division or phase separation of these processes is impossible, then the position control and control of robot's motion interfere and exert the mutual perturbating effect. This influence is caused by kinematic and dynamic interrelations of coordinates of the mechanical system which is balancing freely on the mobile axis: any attempt to start movement or to deviate from the uniform rectilinear motion is accompanied inevitably with the deviation of the robot's longitudinal axis whereas any inclination of the platform leads to the emergence of the torques which move the platform on the surface of rolling. Any intention to suppress the internal interdependence of the coordinates of the system leads to further complication of control algorithms which requires considerable energy resources, viz., the overestimated power of engines and the capacities of storage batteries. To eliminate these fundamental shortcomings the synergetic approach is offered realizing the control of the considered system, i.e. to enter an additional minor operating influence - the position of the center of mass of a system. Working off this influence is carried out by the intrinsic kinematic and dynamic interrelations of the coordinates of a platform. As a result the system movement arises providing the matched solution for both the stabilization of the platform position and its coplanar motion. The two-member return pendulum kinematic scheme with the slowed-down hinge between the links was used for simulation and implementation of this control mode. The motion of the system's center of mass is realized in the form of angular deviation of the top link of a pendulum to the required angle. The mathematical model was built on the basis of the Lagrange's equations for kinetic energy of a system in the generalized coordinates in the form of two nonlinear differential equations of the second order. The center of masses position is entered to these equations in the form of a parameter. Indistinct regulators for each channel of regulation are synthesized and the operability test results of the offered automatic motion control are presented.",synergetic control,mobile robots,motion control of masses center,,"Voronezh State Technical University, Voronezh, Russia; Voronezh State Technical University, Voronezh, Russia",,1,34,,,,,,

Hendry,2022,2022 8th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST),IEEE Conferences,0,"The Tsukamoto and Mamdani fuzzy logic is compared to find the most appropriate fuzzy logic controller for underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) gimbal. The comparison is made by observing the closest estimation from both toward the manual calculation. The Mamdani fuzzy logic is the most appropriate because the error is smaller. This fuzzy logic is implemented on Raspberry Pi with an Ov5647 camera in the real-time experiment. Based on the experiment, the boundaries for fuzzy are set to 220 and 280, and 170 and 200 for vertical and horizontal movement. When dealing with diagonal direction, it always starts with horizontal (X) followed by vertical (Y). The results show that whenever the object's centroid is successfully found, the gimbal automatically converts it to angle and moves the two servo motors accordingly.",ROV,gimbal,servo,Mamdani,Tsukamoto,,"Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",,1,35

Zhao,2021,2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),IEEE Conferences,2,"The stabilized platform can keep the equipment’s horizontal attitude above the carrier stable, provide a relative safe working environment, and possess the motion simulation function. Due to unknown and time-varying environmental information, the platform’s stability control is susceptible to mechanical resonance, parameter gain chattering, and response lag. This paper proposes a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel stabilized platform and elaborates the design concept. A sliding mode variable structure controller (SMC) in single-cylinder based on the Lyapunov stability theory is designed, and we discuss the controller’s adjustability. SMC improves system’s control accuracy and environmental adaptability. Switching feedforward control method is applied to achieve horizontal postures stability. Attitude tracking experiments are carried out under different disturbance conditions to verify the feasibility of the algorithm.",3-DOF platform,Attitude tracking,Feedforward switching,Sliding mode control,,"School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China",,1,36,,,
