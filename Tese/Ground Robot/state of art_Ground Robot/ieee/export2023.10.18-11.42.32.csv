Accurate ship motion control platform is of great importance. It solves problems that are difficult to solve with digital simulation by providing motion attitude monitoring and more realistic simulation environment.

The PTZ stabilizer can enable the object on the carrier platform to achieve attitude stability control, which can automatically keep the camera, mobile phone and other devices stable and balanced during the shooting process, so that the captured images are clearer and the picture quality is better. In this paper, a low-cost, multi-functional, low energy consumption three-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer is designed to solve the problems such as picture shaking of small handheld devices when in motion. The IMU component of the MPU 6050 is used as the angle detection component of the handheld PTZ stabilizer. The Arduino Nano MG996R is used as the microcontroller to process the collected data into angle data, and the PWM signals are outputted by the pins to control the steering gears. The Blender software is used to model and design the 3D model of the PTZ shell, and the Arduino is used to integrate the PTZ control software and hardware, and finally the overall design is optimized. The experiment shows that the design meets the requirement that the carrier coordinate system is stable relative to the geographical coordinate system. Although there is a certain angle error, the overall operation is in good condition. At the same time, it can also suppress the output of a certain axial direction to achieve the function of a two-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer.","2693-3128","978-1-6654-6004-0","10.1109/ITNEC56291.2023.10082408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10082408","three-axis stabilized PTZ;MPU 6050;PID control;Kalman Filter;Arduino Uno development board","Solid modeling;Energy consumption;Three-dimensional displays;Attitude control;Gears;Process control;Information filters","attitude control;cameras;gears;microcontrollers;stability","Arduino NanoMG996R;attitude stability control;handheld devices;low energy consumption three-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer;PTZ shell;PTZ's attitude;two-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer","","","","5","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to guarantee that the reference joint trajectory will produce a safe movement despite modeling errors and perturbations, a stabilizer needs to be implemented on the robot. Though this stabilizer constitutes an essential part of the control strategy of most advanced humanoid platform, it is usually not open-source and dedicated to the own robot characteristics. The goal of this paper is to propose a general and practical strategy for designing a stabilizer for joint-position controlled humanoid robots. The proposed method is based on a double inverted pendulum model and a decoupling approach thanks to which the position of the ZMP and the center of gravity can be controlled independently through the regulation of the ankle and hip joints. The stabilizer generates the expected stabilizing torques from the admissible joint position input. The resulting control algorithm is fast and can be easily executed on the robot. This algorithm was successfully implemented as real-time plugins for the OpenHRP simulator of the HRP2. Simulations showing the efficiency of the method are presented and discussed.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354431","","Robot control;Humanoid robots;Legged locomotion;Stability;Intelligent robots;Open source software;Gravity;Hip;Motion control;USA Councils","humanoid robots;path planning;position control;robot dynamics;stability","decoupled stabilizer;joint-position controlled humanoid robots;dynamically stable walking pattern planning;double inverted pendulum model;zero moment point;OpenHRP simulator","","10","","16","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The space charge distribution characteristics of the composites were measured by a pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) system with an extremely fast pulse burst under ac.

In WAMS, signals are sensed by phasor measurement units (PMUs) and transmitted to phasor data concentrators (PDCs) as packets with a time tag using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Data is stored and aligned with respect to its time tag in PDC, when the packet drop occurs it results into absence of data at that particular instant and causes vacancies. In this paper, moving average method is proposed in order to estimate these vacancies. The estimated remote signal is used as input instead of signal with drops. The tuning of WAPSS is done by slap swarm algorithm (SSA) considering integral time absolute speed deviation (ISD) as objective function.

Stochastic errors in quantum systems occur randomly but coherent errors are more damaging since they can accumulate in a particular direction. We consider coherent noise acting transversally, giving rise to an effective error which is a  $Z$ -rotation on each qubit by some angle  $\theta $ . Rather than address coherent noise through active error correction, we investigate passive mitigation through decoherence free subspaces. In the language of stabilizer codes, we require the noise to preserve the code space, and to act trivially (as the logical identity operator) on the protected information. Thus, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal  $Z$ -rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code. These conditions require the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of the  $X$ -component of some stabilizer. Furthermore, the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes with even block length. By adjusting the sizes of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes oblivious to coherent noise, one that includes the  $[[4L^{2}, 1, 2L]]$  Shor codes. The Shor codes are examples of constant excitation codes, where logical qubits are encoded as a code state that is a sum of physical states indexed by binary vectors with the same weight. Constant excitation codes are oblivious to coherent noise since a transversal  $Z$ -rotation acts as a global phase. We prove that a CSS code is oblivious to coherent noise if and only if it is a constant excitation code, and that if the code is error-detecting, then the (constant) weights in different cosets of the  $X$ -stabilizers are identical.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2021.3130155","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CCF-2106213,CCF-1908730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624967","Coherent noise;decoherence-free subspace (DFS);transversal Z-rotations;necessary conditions;constant excitation code","Codes;Qubit;Computers;Product codes;Stochastic processes;Quantum system;Ions","error correction;error correction codes;parity check codes;quantum communication;quantum computing;stochastic processes","stabilizer code;single-parity-check codes;QECC codes;Shor codes;constant excitation code;code state;coherent noise;balancing weight-2 Z-stabilizers;stochastic errors;code space","","3","","40","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such an assumption however, impacts the effectiveness of controllers and state-estimators in such systems. This article presents a reaction-based stabilizer for nonmodel-based vibration control of CDPRs to address such model dependence. It is proved analytically that by using only three actuators and not involving the cable-connected winches, the proposed stabilizer regulates all undesired vibrations of the platform. It is also shown that the proposed stabilizer needs only the directly measurable position and velocity of its actuators to form its closed-loop control feedback signals. Effectiveness of the proposed system is more significant in CDPRs with considerable nonlinear effects of cables, where such effects are computationally costly to model, such that the performance of real-time controllers and state-estimators are spoiled. To provide a case study, a multibody nonlinear dynamic model of a suspended CDPR equipped-with the proposed stabilizer with zero cable damping effects is developed in SimMechanics/MATLAB, where a fine-tuned proportional-derivative controller is applied on each actuator to suppress all vibrations of the system. In addition, a suspended CDPR with extremely stretchable nonlinear-stiffness elastomer cables is fabricated and tested, where performance of the proposed stabilizer to suppress the high-amplitude nonlinear oscillations of the whole system is demonstrated.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2020.3031269","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244644","Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs);mechanism design;underactuated systems;vibration control","Vibrations;Stability analysis;Asymptotic stability;Actuators;Computational modeling;Damping;Control design","cables (mechanical);closed loop systems;control system synthesis;damping;elastomers;feedback;flexible structures;industrial robots;nonlinear control systems;nonlinear dynamical systems;PD control;position control;stability;three-term control;vibration control;vibrations","reaction-based stabilizer;nonmodel-based vibration control;cable-driven parallel robots;essential assumption;state-estimator;CDPRs;model dependence;actuator;cable-connected winches;undesired vibrations;directly measurable position;closed-loop control feedback signals;considerable nonlinear effects;real-time controllers;multibody nonlinear dynamic model;zero cable damping effects;proportional-derivative controller;nonlinear-stiffness elastomer cables","","9","","18","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Driven primarily by increases in power electronically-coupled generation and load, the dynamics of large-scale power systems are rapidly changing. Electric grids are losing inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. The system load is becoming stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In parallel, advancements in wide-area measurement technology have made it possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted over long distances in nearly real time. In this paper, we present a power system stabilizer architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the standard Δω-type stabilizer. The control strategy utilizes a real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from wide-area measurements. This approach creates a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response, making synchronous generators better able to adapt to changes in system dynamics. The phenomena of interest are examined using a two-area test case and a reduced-order model of the North American Western Interconnection. To validate the key findings under realistic conditions, we employ a state-of-the-art co-simulation platform to combine high-fidelity power system and communication network models.

In most of the developing countries, this low cost power generation plays vital role in balancing the energy markets in terms of its economic operation. But, owing to its large installation capacity, the alternators possess huge rating and size. As the rating and the size increases, the machine start and stop procedure pro-longs and hence the term stability is attained after a minimum period of start of generation. This is due to the high inertia constant and in detail due to the lack of synchronization which leads to excessive damping of the entire system. And hence optimal design of the damping coefficient ( KD) is desired in order to bring the system to stability. The KD directly depends on the respective damping coefficient design of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) and the Power System Stabilizers (PSS). A small signal stability experienced by such systems may be due to two reasons a) Due to Electric Dynamics (ED) b) Due to Non-Electric Dynamics (NED). The former is a most common phenomenon and is most widely monitored. But the latter is often discarded in majority of the stability analysis. Earlier studies have pinpoint results on the impacts of NED on the stability of the system. And hence, a joint research analysis on optimal modeling of the damping coefficient and the impacts of NED have scope in the installed systems. The work presented here concentrates on two thing a) optimal model-ling of the KD and later optimally reducing its settling time using constrained optimization technique b) upon the designed value of KD the impact of NED is studied and inference is discussed. The entire work is carried out by taking a large hydro-alternator of 66.67MVA which is installed at a Hydro Electric Generating Station located in India. The alternator is optimally modeled using dynamic equations and then the settling time is further optimized. Later the developed model is taken out for analysis of NED. The work is carried out in MATLAB Simulink Platform.","","978-1-7281-0167-5","10.1109/ICECA.2019.8821829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821829","Damping coefficient (KD);Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR);Power System Stabilizers (PSS);Non-Electric Dynamics (NED);Constraint Optimization","Mathematical model;Damping;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Power system dynamics;Alternators;Aerodynamics","alternators;hydroelectric power stations;Matlab;optimisation;power generation control;power generation economics;power markets;power system simulation;power system stability;synchronisation;voltage control","NED;optimal modeling;settling time;dynamic equations;optimum modelling;energy source;low cost power generation;energy markets;power system stabilizers;signal stability analysis;electric dynamics;nonelectric dynamics;constrained optimization technique;damping coefficient design;hydro alternator;system replacement;economic operation;machine stop procedure;machine start procedure;automatic voltage regulation;India;hydro electric generating station;MATLAB Simulink;apparent power 66.67 MVA","","1","","12","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motion control with respect to stability of dynamically stable mobile manipulators is one the interesting challenges in robotics. Mobile robots with small base are capable of moving in limited space. A Ballbot is an underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. It is as tall as human height until could interact by people whereas a Ballbot has not been equipped with a manipulator for grasping objects. In this paper, it has been equipped with a PUMA type manipulator which gives to the proposed robot the capability of object manipulation. Because of passive joints, Ballbot cannot maintain stability and following desired end-effector trajectory. So, a 2 DOF stabilizing pendulum is used to help the stability of a system and make the manipulator practical. As a result, dynamics equations of the assumed mobile robot are presented. Furthermore, a model-based controller is described to move the end-effector along the desired path/trajectory and maintains the system balance. Obtained results show the capabilities of the proposed control algorithm in satisfying the desired objectives.","","978-1-4673-5811-8","10.1109/ICRoM.2013.6510111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6510111","Ballbot;Mobile Manipulator;Stability;Motion Control","Robots;Motion control","end effectors;manipulator dynamics;mobile robots;motion control;pendulums;stability","dynamics modeling;armed control;mobile manipulator;motion control;mobile robots;nonholonomic dynamic constraints;grasping objects;PUMA type manipulator;object manipulation;passive joints;end-effector trajectory;2 DOF stabilizing pendulum","","3","","15","IEEE","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The oscillatory mode instability occurs in the power system due to various reasons like fast-acting exciters with high gain, heavy power transfer over a weak transmission line, etc. In this paper, static var compensator (SVC) is used to improve the system stability and performance by providing damping to the low-frequency inter-area mode of oscillation. To provide damping effectively to such mode simultaneous tuning of SVC and power system stabilizer (PSS) is mendatory under the different operating conditions of the power system. Moreover, to achieve controllability in the power system, the flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) device and the PSS should be located optimally. In this paper, a residue-based method has been used to find the optimal location of the SVC controller for damping of the inter-area mode of oscillations and the optimal location of PSS is determined by participation factors. The proposed method is implemented on Four-machine, Ten-bus, Two-area test system. Simulation studies have been carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform to verify the performance of with and without SVC and PSS for the test systems under three operating conditions, i.e., light loading, nominal loading, heavy loading conditions. In addition to this, eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulation results are used to evaluate the performance of the system under above three loading conditions. The results confirm that the proposed approach significantly enhances the stability of the inter-area oscillation mode under all loading conditions.","2474-1507","978-1-6654-3451-5","10.1109/AUPEC52110.2021.9597791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597791","Static Var Compensator;Conventional Power System Stabilizer;Power Oscillation Damping;Residue Factor;Participation Factor","Damping;Loading;Flexible AC transmission systems;Static VAr compensators;Power system stability;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Stability analysis","controllability;damping;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;flexible AC transmission systems;power system simulation;power system stability;power transmission control;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;static VAr compensators;time-domain analysis","SVC;power system stability;mode simultaneous tuning;power system stabilizer;PSS;flexible ac transmission systems device;optimal location;two-area test system;inter-area oscillation mode;inter-area oscillations damping;local mode;oscillatory mode instability;heavy power transfer;ten-bus test systems;optimal placement;residue technique;system blackout;static var compensator;low-frequency inter-area mode;controllability;FACTS;residue-based method;four-machine test system;MATLAB-Simulink platform;light loading;nominal loading;heavy loading conditions;eigenvalue analysis;time-domain simulation","","3","","15","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper briefly reviews the problems associated with the existing methods for reliable and accurate rotor speed measurement or estimation. It is shown that the existing methods of rotor speed estimation have some severe drawbacks and may cause the power system stabilizer to operate suboptimal or even produce negative damping over a specific frequency range when an inaccurate rotor speed signal is used as the input to the power system stabilizer. Most importantly it demonstrates that a system equipped with it behaves as predicted in simulations, especially when examining inter-area modes. The new rotor speed estimation method was implemented on an industrial control platform and integrated in a modern digital excitation system. A series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations were run to examine the properties of the new speed estimator. The simulations confirm that the new speed offers superior performance in terms of speed estimation accuracy, which allows the proper damping of oscillations over a frequency range of interest.","1932-5517","978-1-4799-6415-4","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939533","","Rotors;Estimation;Shafts;Frequency measurement;Power system stability;Damping;Oscillators","angular velocity measurement;damping;industrial control;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;power grids;power system reliability;power system stability;rotors;synchronous machines","rotor angular speed measurement;power grid stabilization;extended Kalman filter-based method;synchronous machine;power system stabilizer;rotor angular speed estimation;negative damping;industrial control platform;digital excitation system;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;oscillation damping","","2","","7","IEEE","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, reading the sentences or equations from videos is very uncomfortable due to the paper movements when teacher wrote the sentences. In addition, teacher's hand frequently occludes the answers during the recording process. In the study, a video stabilizer with hand removal is proposed for comfortably reading. There are two key components: Video stabilization and sentence identification. Video stabilization estimates the smooth camera paths using SURF -based corner detection, hand part removal, image registration, and frame calibration. In sentence identification, sentences are segmented and extracted using contour detection and the convex hull generation algorithm. After the calibration process, users won't fell dizzy in reading sentences from calibrated and un-shaky videos.

The Heffron-Philips (HP) model which is equivalent linearization model of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) is considered for small signal stability. The power system stabilizer (PSS) with automatic voltage regulator (AVR) in synchronous generator produces sufficient damping torque and synchronizing torque so as to destabilize the small signal instability during small change in system variables. This paper presents the control design of PD based PSS which supplements the damping torque and reduces the transient oscillations by reducing setting time at constant damping ratio in system response.

In the last decades, significant number of these type of controllers have become fully operational to achieve different functionalities and improve the flexibility and controllability of the grid. However, design and application of a system-level controller that dynamically changes the set points of the local devices based on the grid conditions, still needs lots of nurturing. This paper concerns with the enhanced utilization of system-wide controllable resources in the New York State grid as the system conditions vary. To achieve the greatest benefit we propose a data-driven decision system for grid management, which offers the application of a wide-area system awareness platform for adaptive utilization of the system-wide controllable resources. The solution is broad in nature but as a starting point, in this paper, the attention is given to dynamically changing the set points of shunt-connected FACTS devices in order to minimize system violations following a major disturbance. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified on a unique system that uses the real data of the New York State grid.

They should be appropriately damped in order to avoid severe contingencies in the power system. Various methodologies are adopted to tackle these situations. In the modern power system scenario, management of the distribution side, i.e., load side, is a competent way to make the system stable. However, they are either deployed on the generation or transmission sides. Hence we propose a wide-area damping controller (WADC), which modulates active power on the load side to damp critical LFOs. This system is linearized at a stable operating point, and critical LFOs are identified using modal analysis. Furthermore, geometric measures are utilized to find suitable feedback signals for them. The WADC structure is considered as a one-stage power system stabilizer (PSS). The parameters of WADC are tuned by the metaheuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to achieve the desired damping ratio. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, dynamic simulations are conducted on 4-machine 11-machine system. Results are generated on MATLAB/SIMULINK® platform, which suggests that the system is able to achieve the desired damping performance with the proposed WADC design.","","978-1-6654-4357-9","10.1109/GlobConET53749.2022.9872521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9872521","Wide-area damping control;Active power modulation;Low-frequency oscillation;Local and inter-area mode;Small-signal analysis","Damping;Fluctuations;Power demand;Power system dynamics;Modulation;Power system stability;Particle measurements","control system synthesis;damping;feedback;metaheuristics;modal analysis;oscillations;particle swarm optimisation;power system control;power system measurement;power system stability","active power demand;low-frequency oscillations;power system stability;one-stage power system stabilizer;4-machine 11-machine system;WADC design;wide-area damping controller design;LFOs;modal analysis;feedback signals;PSS;metaheuristic particle swarm optimization technique;PSO;MATLAB-SIMULINK platform","","","","13","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We view coherent errors as rotations about a particular axis, and observe that since they can accumulate coherently over time, they can be more damaging. It is natural to consider coherent noise acting transversally giving rise to an effective error, which is a $Z$-rotation on each qubit by some angle $\theta$. Rather than addressing coherent noise through active error correction, we instead investigate passive mitigation through decoherence free subspaces. In the language of stabilizer codes, we require the noise to preserve the code space, and to act trivially (as the logical identity operator) on the protected information. Thus, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal $Z$-rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code. These conditions require the existence of a large number of weight 2 $Z$-stabilizers, and together, these weight 2 $Z$-stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes. By adjusting the size of these components, we are able to construct a large family of CSS codes, oblivious to coherent noise, that includes the $[[4L^{2}, 1,2L]]$ Shor codes. Given $m$ even and given any $[[n, k, d]]$ CSS code, we can construct an $[[mn, k, d^{\prime}\geq d]]$ CSS code that is oblivious to coherent noise. This result is generalized to stabilizer codes in [Hu, Liang, Rengaswamy, and Calderbank 2020]. The MacWilliams Identities play a central role in the technical analysis, and classical coding theorists may be interested in connections to classical codes with all weights divisible by some integer $d$.","","978-1-5386-8209-8","10.1109/ISIT45174.2021.9518206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9518206","coherent noise;DFS;transversal $Z$-rotations;Clifford hierarchy;MacWilliams identities","Sufficient conditions;Qubit;Stochastic processes;Ions;Encoding;Error correction;Manganese","error correction;error correction codes;parity check codes;quantum computing;stochastic processes","CSS code;coherent noise;coherent errors;stabilizer code;code space","","2","","13","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to create a sturdy and stable platform for pavement, soil modification and stabilization with combined ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), carbide lime (CL) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was employed in this study. Mix proportion parameters of stabilized soils are analyzed by using the Taguchi's experiment design methodology for optimal design. Results show that OPC and GGBFS content play significant roles for the early strength and long-term strength of stabilized soil, respectively; whereas CL has an optimum content of 9% at the initial stages. Maximum unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 1.61 and 2.32 MPa were achieved, respectively, at the optimum conditions of 4%GGBFS/6%CL//3.2%OPC at the curing age of 7 and 28 days. Splitting tensile strength (STS) increases rapidly with curing ages and reaches 0.45-0.48 MPa at the age of 56d. More dosage of carbide lime can help to the long-term strength. The GGBFS/CL/OPC-stabilized soil has a high durability. After 10 wet-dry cycles the strength loss ratio remains within 10%; after 10 freeze-thaw cycles the weight loss is below 8%. California bearing ratio (CBR) was conducted on the soil alone and the soil-stabilizer mixture. CBR ranging between 158 and 224 were obtained for the 7 days curing, whereas the silt typically has CBR less than 3.1 in its wet state. Field test was also conducted during construction using Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) to assess the strength of stabilized soil in situ. DCP test indicated that the strength development of GGBFS/CL/OPC stabilized subgrade is more rapid and the improvement of subgrade bearing capacity can facilitate an increase in compaction degree of subbase..","","978-1-4244-7739-5","10.1109/MACE.2010.5536286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5536286","pavement;wet subgrade;high groundwater table;silt;soil stabilization;industry by-product;ground granulated blast furnace slag;carbide lime","Blast furnaces;Slag;Soil;Curing;Design methodology;Testing;Telecommunication traffic;Sociotechnical systems;Vehicle dynamics;Compaction","blast furnaces;cements (building materials);compressive strength;design of experiments;groundwater;road building;slag;soil;tensile strength","silt subgrade modification;stabilization;ground granulated blast furnace slag;carbide lime;groundwater;deformation;wet silt subgrade;pavements construction;regular vehicular traffic loads;soil modification;Portland cement;Taguchi experiment design;optimal design;unconfined compressive strength;splitting tensile strength;California bearing ratio;soil-stabilizer mixture;dynamic cone penetrometer","","2","","12","IEEE","3 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The theoretical framework that underpins these techniques assumes that an aggregated control area (CA) model can be defined, assuming that the dynamic response of the entire CA is dominated by a single energy source, typically a steam-turbine generator. This paper investigates a combined AGC and ED control methodology for a power system with CAs containing multiple hybrid energy resources that cannot be simply aggregated into a single equivalent source. An optimization approach is then used to develop a control law and parameter design algorithm for each energy source, which accounts for their individual dynamics while aggregating the generators output to match with the target output of the CA. The performance of the proposed AGC and ED controller is demonstrated using simulation studies of an interconnected power system, conducted within the DIgSILENT power factory platform. This model incorporates non-linear network system dynamics and control loops within automatic voltage regulators and power system stabilizers. The study results indicate that the proposed AGC optimal control strategy offers superior performance compared to traditional and recently published economic AGC strategies, particularly when the generation mix includes both dispatchable conventional sources and a high penetration of non-dispatchable or semi-dispatchable sources such as wind.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2907614","Australian Research Council Discovery Program(grant numbers:#DP170102303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8678464","Automatic generation control (AGC);combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs);generation portfolio;interconnected power network;optimal control;renewable energy resources (RESs);steam turbines","Automatic generation control;Power system dynamics;Turbines;Frequency control;Economics;Generators;Power system stability","distributed power generation;optimal control;optimisation;power generation control;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power grids;power system stability;renewable energy sources;voltage regulators","optimal automatic generation control;multiarea power system;diverse energy resources;power system control methodologies;combine economic dispatch;economic operation;generation mix;renewable energy sources;aggregated control area model;dynamic response;single energy source;steam-turbine generator;combined AGC;control methodology;multiple hybrid energy resources;single equivalent source;optimization approach;control law;individual dynamics;generators output;interconnected power system;DIgSILENT power factory platform;nonlinear network system dynamics;control loops;automatic voltage regulators;power system stabilizers;AGC optimal control strategy;traditional published economic AGC strategies;recently published economic AGC strategies;dispatchable conventional sources;semidispatchable sources","","39","","31","IEEE","31 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At its core is a novel high-resolution imaging spectrometer that records solar reflected light between 1.99 and 2.42 pm at 1 nm resolution, including strong methane (CH4) bands in the short-wave infrared. The push-broom spectrometer will leverage recent advancements in grating design and large-format 2D focal plane arrays to enable - for the first time - the high spectral resolution necessary for trace gas retrievals combined with high-performance imaging capabilities developed for surface remote sensing. AMPS features a 36° field of view with 600 resolved spatial elements across track (1 mRad) and 431 pixels in the spectral dimension. All other aspects of the instrument, such as the telescope, cryo-cooler, image stabilizer, GPS, are identical to available airborne JPL spectrometers in operation. The AMPS design is based on the next generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG), which has been used for high resolution mapping of CH4 concentrations from a controlled release experiment [1] and over existing natural gas fields [2]. A real time CH4 plume detection capability originally developed for AVIRIS-NG and successfully demonstrated over oil fields [3] will also be implemented with AMPS. This will facilitate surveys over existing oil and gas fields to identify and attribute CH4 emissions to individual point source locations, permit adaptive surveys with repeat imaging of suspected sources, and allow real time communication to site operators or ground crews equipped with additional instruments to verify observed plumes. AMPS will enable quantitative imaging of CH4 plumes at unprecedented spatial resolution and precision. Using a slow moving platform such as a helicopter at 100 m flight altitude (60 m image swath) will permit imaging CH4 enhancements at 10 cm spatial resolution and an unprecedented accuracy of 0.05 g CH4/m2. This will allow robust detection of CH4 emissions as low as 0.17 m3/h (6 standard cubic feet per hour), an order of magnitude smaller than what current airborne systems can detect. Using fixed-wing aircraft, AMPS can also be flown faster and higher (1 to 8 km flight altitude), thereby providing larger image swaths (0.6 to 4.8 km swaths respectively) and effective large scale surveys. Mapping CH4 emissions to individual point source locations could allow site operators to identify and mitigate these emissions, which reflect both a potential safety hazard and lost revenue. For the regulatory and scientific communities, understanding the distribution (spatial, temporal) and size of these emissions is of interest given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic emissions, including industrial point source emissions and fugitive CH4 from oil and gas infrastructure.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500756","","Spatial resolution;Imaging;Instruments;Atmospheric measurements;Absorption;Optical surface waves","geophysical equipment;infrared imaging","methane plume quantitative imaging;Airborne Methane Plume Spectrometer;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;high-resolution imaging spectrometer;solar reflected light;strong methane bands;short-wave infrared;push-broom spectrometer;grating design;large-format 2D focal plane arrays;high spectral resolution;trace gas retrievals;high-performance imaging capabilities;surface remote sensing;field of view;spatial elements;spectral dimension;image stabilizer;cryo-cooler;GPS;telescope;airborne JPL spectrometers;next generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer;CH4 concentration high resolution mapping;controlled release experiment;natural gas fields;CH4 plume detection capability;oil field;gas field;CH4 emissions;individual point source locations;adaptive surveys;suspected source repeat imaging;real time communication;site operators;unprecedented spatial resolution;slow moving platform;helicopter;flight altitude;image swath;CH4 emission detection;airborne systems;fixed-wing aircraft;effective large scale surveys;safety hazard;emissions size;anthropogenic emissions;industrial point source emissions;oil-gas infrastructure","","12","","33","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

UMAP integrates parallel and sequential processing layers which consist of heterogeneous functional IPs for general media contents processing on today's application processors (AP). Based on the heterogeneous many-core platform, UMAP supports not only graphics and vision processing for real-time augmented reality (AR) but also disparity estimation and 3D display synthesis for 3D-view AR acceleration. A new concept of 3D-view AR which synthesizes 3D display contents from two vertically aligned stereo images and a self-constructed disparity map is introduced to achieve true realism for next generation mobile devices. For low-cost 3D-view AR processing, a homography-based disparity estimation (HDE) algorithm is proposed to construct a disparity map between two stereo images with small implementation overhead. For real-time and energy-efficient system organization, workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture and a mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) are also implemented in UMAP. The 3-stage pipelined system which consists of graphics, vision, and display operation stages reduces per-frame execution latency, while dynamic analog/digital mode reconfiguration based on mixed-mode FEE reduces per-frame energy dissipation, so real-time energy-efficient 3D-view AR can be realized in UMAP. FEE performs high-speed corner detection for vision processing based on four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCLs). Especially, a diode-connected current sensing stabilizer (CSS) in each CCL reduces minimum sensing current for corner detection, so average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In 2D or 3D-view AR processing, FEE with four CCLs replaces the parallel processing core cluster which is the most power hungry IP in UMAP, so 96.7% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved in real operation. Based on the 3-stage pipelined architecture with the dynamic mode reconfiguration technique, the entire UMAP achieves up to 64.4% of energy reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art media processors in full operation.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2013.2259042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6518179","Augmented reality (AR);feature extraction;media application processor;mixed-mode;vision;3D display;3D graphics;3D-view AR","Three-dimensional displays;Media;Graphics;Parallel processing;Image analysis;Estimation;Vectors","augmented reality;computer graphics;computer vision;edge detection;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;stereo image processing","unified media application processor;dynamic analog-digital mode reconfiguration;embedded 3D-media contents processing;UMAP;2D image analysis;3D image analysis;image synthesis;parallel processing layer;sequential processing layer;heterogeneous functional IP;media content processing;heterogeneous many-core platform;vision processing;augmented reality;3D display synthesis;3D-view AR acceleration;stereo image;self-constructed disparity map;mobile device;homography-based disparity estimation algorithm;HDE algorithm;energy-efficient system organization;workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture;mixed-mode feature extraction engine;3-stage pipelined system;graphics operation stage;vision operation stage;display operation stage;mixed-mode FEE;per-frame energy dissipation;energy-efficient 3D-view AR;corner detection;analog current contention logic;CCL;diode-connected current sensing stabilizer;CSS;2D-view AR processing;3D-view AR processing;dynamic mode reconfiguration technique;energy reduction","","2","","27","IEEE","22 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other","S. Haykin; J. M.

The first part of the paper is of a tutorial nature, addressing recent advances in cognitive perception and cognitive control, which are the dual of each other. The study of cognitive perception, viewed from the perspective of Bayesian inference, starts with sparse coding, well known in neuroscience. However, sparse coding could become ill-posed, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such situations, stability is a necessary requirement, which can only be satisfied if there is sufficient information in the observables. To satisfy this requirement, the sparse-coding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information filtering (i.e., a special case of Bayesian filtering). Accordingly, the performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of perceptual attention. This improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor to separate relevant information from irrelevant information. Next, moving into cognitive control, viewed from the perspective of Bellman's dynamic programming, two ideas are exploited: entropic state of the perceptor, and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two entropic states, namely, the current state and its immediate past value. The net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of Bellman's dynamic programming, and, therefore, a new reinforcement learning algorithm, which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, but also offers some highly desirable properties. Among them is a linear law of computational complexity, which is the best that it could be. The second part of the paper addresses two challenging problems: first, how to mediate between cognitive control and cognitive perception and, second, how to formulate a procedure for risk control. The first problem is resolved by making use of probabilistic reasoning, a branch of probability theory, which leads into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine. With this mediation in place, the conditions for overall system stability are derived, thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the overall system stabilizer. The second challenge is risk control, which is by far the most challenging of them all: In the presence of an unexpected disturbance in the environment, risk is brought under control by mimicking the predict and preadapt function, which is considered to be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. To be specific, motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new preadaptive control mechanism, which involves two different sets of actions: One set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy in the motor control. The other set involves a window of experiences (i.e., optimal actions) gained in the past. In a novel way, by exploiting these two sets, we end up with a preadaptive control mechanism in the form of a closed-loop feedback structure, which brings with it control (executive) attention.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2311211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777299","Attention;cognition;control;entropic state;intelligence;memory;perception;pre-adaptation;prediction;risk control;self-organization;system stability","Cognitive science;Neuroscience;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Encoding;Thermal stability;Entropy;Predictive methods","belief networks;brain;closed loop systems;cognition;computational complexity;dynamic programming;entropy;feedback;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);neurophysiology;probability","engineering learning;cognitive dynamic systems;cognitive neuroscience;cognitive perception;cognitive control;Bayesian inference;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse-coding algorithm;information filtering;Bayesian filtering;perceptual attention;Bellman dynamic programming;entropic state;reward;invertible function;reinforcement learning algorithm;linear law;computational complexity;risk control;probability theory;probabilistic reasoning machine;system stability;system stabilizer;brain prefrontal cortex;motor control;preadaptive control mechanism;closed-loop feedback structure","","62","","52","IEEE","21 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Driven primarily by increases in power electronically-coupled generation and load, the dynamics of large-scale power systems are rapidly changing. Electric grids are losing inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. The system load is becoming stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In parallel, advancements in wide-area measurement technology have made it possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted over long distances in nearly real time. In this paper, we present a power system stabilizer architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the standard $\Delta \omega -$ type stabilizer. The control strategy utilizes a real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from wide-area measurements. This approach creates a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response, making synchronous generators better able to adapt to changes in system dynamics. The phenomena of interest are examined using a two-area test case and a reduced-order model of the North American Western Interconnection. To validate the key findings under realistic conditions, we employ a state-of-the-art co-simulation platform to combine high-fidelity power system and communication network models.

Grid-forming (GFM) control has been appointed as the technology required for achieving a high penetration of renewables in the grid, as it successfully contributes to the power system stability. This paper proposes a novel grid-forming control scheme for voltage source converters (VSC) achieving the operational characteristics of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM). The proposed scheme is based on the orientation of a defined virtual flux to a reference axis obtained from the emulation of the synchronous generator swing equation. The virtual flux is obtained by the integration of the VSC internal voltage and it is oriented to the reference axis by means of a flux controller that also controls the flux magnitude. In this way, the VSC synchronism is maintained, operating as a voltage source connected to the grid. Moreover, the flux orientation in turn allows to control the VSC active power, while the flux magnitude control allows to regulate the VSC reactive power or terminal voltage in isolated mode. The paper also demonstrates that the stability of GFM converters is negatively affected when emulating high inertia values. So, a stabilizer is also proposed for damping these modes. Finally, due to fact that GFM converters behave as voltage sources, their low voltage ride through capability becomes an issue, because they naturally respond to faults with high short-circuit currents, that cannot be withstand by power electronics converters. Therefore, a method for limiting fault currents is proposed as well in the paper. The proposed grid-forming control scheme has been implemented in a real-time control platform and validated using comprehensive simulation models in a real-time simulator for assessing its grid-forming capability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10029353","Grid-forming power converter;virtual-flux orientation;virtual synchronous machines","Voltage control;Power system stability;Synchronization;Voltage measurement;Renewable energy sources;Regulators;Limiting;Power grids;Synchronous machines","HVDC power convertors;power convertors;power electronics;power generation control;power grids;power system stability;short-circuit currents;synchronous generators;synchronous machines;voltage control;voltage-source convertors","defined virtual flux;emulating high inertia values;flux controller;flux magnitude control;GFM converters;grid-forming capability;novel grid-forming control scheme;operational characteristics;power electronics converters;power system stability;power systems;real-time control platform;reference axis;renewable generation;synchronous generator swing equation;terminal voltage;virtual synchronous machine;virtual-flux orientation;voltage source converters;VSC active power;VSC internal voltage;VSC synchronism","","2","","74","CCBY","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, most RESs are connected to the grid through inverters or converters, which are power electronic interfaces. Utilizing converters and inverters will significantly decrease the power system's inertia due to the absence of rotating mass. As a result, the use of advanced technologies to achieve and maintain frequency stability is essential in power systems. This work proposes two new control coordination i) virtual inertia and ii) superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) of load frequency control (LFC) along with a PI controller. Since SMES technology and virtual inertia are both effective energy storage systems and frequency stabilizers, respectively, this research develops two controllers to emulate inertia utilizing SMES. The mathematical model is developed to facilitate control design and implementation in simulation platform. The developed techniques show better performance in reducing the frequency deviation of highly RESs integrated system. Three loads are considered in this study to check the stability and effectiveness of the proposed control coordination. Determining the best approach by analyzing the two controllers individual outputs is one of this work's main purposes.","","979-8-3503-4536-0","10.1109/ECCE57851.2023.10101617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101617","RESs;Micro-grid;Wind power;Load frequency control (LFC);Rate of change of frequency (ROCOF);Virtual inertia;SMES;Frequency stability;Power imbalance","Renewable energy sources;PI control;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Mathematical models;Inverters;Superconducting magnetic energy storage","control system synthesis;frequency control;frequency stability;load regulation;mathematical analysis;PI control;power electronics;power generation control;power grids;renewable energy sources;superconducting magnet energy storage","control coordination;control design;converters;energy storage systems;frequency deviation;frequency stability;inverters;LFC;load frequency analysis;load frequency control;mathematical model;optimal virtual inertia;PI controller;power electronic interfaces;random load;renewable energy sources;RES;SMES;superconducting magnetic energy storage;virtual inertia","","","","19","IEEE","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
