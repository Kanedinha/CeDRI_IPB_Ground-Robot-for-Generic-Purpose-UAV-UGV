In our proposed algorithm, we first estimate the translational motion by projecting the vertical and horizontal details of stationary wavelet decomposition in level 2. These parameters are used as initial estimation of motion's parameters. Then, we use several feature points and a gradient based algorithm to estimate the precise motion parameters. We compared our algorithm with two other algorithms, i.e. Moriomoto and Guestrin's stabilization algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm has superior performance than these two.","1522-4880","0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1246697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246697","","Digital images;Wavelet transforms;Motion estimation;Cameras;Parameter estimation;Layout;Video sequences;Two dimensional displays;Educational institutions;Accelerometers","wavelet transforms;motion estimation;image processing;gradient methods","electronic digital image stabilization;stationary wavelet decomposition;motion parameter estimation;gradient based algorithm","","7","3","10","IEEE","24 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Double Hybrid Tailsitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle With Vertical Takeoff and Landing","A. N. De Lucena; B. M. F. Da Silva; L. M. G. Gonçalves","Graduate program in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal-RN, Brazil; Graduate program in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal-RN, Brazil; Graduate program in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal-RN, Brazil","IEEE Access","30 Mar 2022","2022","10","","32938","32953","We propose a new double-hybrid concept and architectural design of a tailsitter unmanned aerial vehicle with vertical takeoff and landing capability. Basically, it consists of a modified flying wing with a single combustion powertrain set and a multirotor with 2 powertrain sets with electric motors. With the electric propellers fixed at the leading wing edge, the tailsitter has two standard surfaces for elevation control and two vertical stabilizers that are used to give the necessary direction on vertical takeoff and landing. We have designed, built, and tested a prototype based on this new double-hybrid concept, which spends less energy on vertical taking off and landing and also on horizontal flight, thus maximizing flight endurance and travelled distance. We performed several experimental tests starting with the aircraft on the ground in vertical positioning. These tests include executing vertical takeoffs and landing, transitions from vertical to horizontal flight modes and transitions back (from horizontal to vertical), and hovering, which were carried out successfully. Transitions fourth and back from combustion to multirotor are inherent to some of those flight mode transitions, which have also been performed smoothly. We also performed tests (in bench) to estimate the maximum flight duration, which has demonstrated about 32 minutes of endurance. To this end, the proposed and currently built double-hybrid prototype has proven to be functional as an effective hybrid UAV system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161490","Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement (CAPES), Brazil(grant numbers:001); Pro-Alertas(grant numbers:311789/2021-8); National Research Council (CNPq)(grant numbers:311640/2018-4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739654","Unmanned aerial vehicle;double hybrid tailsitter;architectural design;vertical takeoff and landing","Mechanical power transmission;Combustion;Prototypes;Propellers;Mathematical models;Engines;Rotors","autonomous aerial vehicles;helicopters","single combustion powertrain;vertical stabilizers;horizontal flight modes;flight mode transitions;modified flying wing;double hybrid tailsitter unmanned aerial vehicle;vertical takeoff and landing;hybrid UAV system;multirotor;time 32.0 min","","1","","48","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The disturbance of wind and waves affects the stability of the ship’s course and makes the ship roll violently. Ships are usually equipped with an autopilot to control the course and a fin stabilizer to reduce rolling during navigation and improve stability and safety. Fin-rudder joint control system considers the coupling effect of the ship’s horizontal plane motion, thereby improving the performance of the rudder and the fin stabilizer. This paper presents an improved linear-quadratic-regulator control algorithm. A rate control law with no static error is proposed based on the traditional linear-quadratic-regulator to eliminate the static error of the state vector and achieve a better control effect. Additionally, a closed-loop state observer is used to estimate the system’s state vector, and a dynamic corrector is designed to reduce rolling and heading angle deviation caused by sea wave interference. The simulation results show that the designed fin-rudder joint controller with the improved linear-quadratic-regulator algorithm can achieve more than 80% roll reduction effect at level 3 and 5 sea states, and has better course keeping ability compared with the rudder control.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3214831","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:u1964202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919833","Fin-rudder joint control;linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR);roll reduction;rate control law with no static error;dynamic corrector","Mathematical models;Marine vehicles;Autopilot;Simulation;Actuators;Stability criteria;Navigation","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;disasters;linear quadratic control;motion control;navigation;nonlinear control systems;observers;ships;stability","improved linear-quadratic-regulator algorithm;disasters;ships sail;wave conditions;ship roll;fin stabilizer;fin-rudder joint control system;improved linear-quadratic-regulator control algorithm;rate control law;static error;traditional linear-quadratic-regulator;control effect;sea wave interference;fin-rudder joint controller;80% roll reduction effect;5 sea states;rudder control","","2","","30","CCBY","14 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main sources of regenerative energy in the more electric aircraft power distribution system are the aircraft actuation systems: ailerons, rudder, flaps, spoilers, horizontal stabilizers and others. Instead of dissipating the energy as heat, the regenerative electric energy from the motor drives can be stored in energy storage elements such as flywheels, ultra-capacitors and batteries. Using the Simcaps toolbox, an aileron model with the electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) is developed in Matlab/Simulink. This regenerative power system consisting of a synchronous generator, three-phase-to dc boost rectifier, EMA including an input filter, ESE and a bidirectional dc-dc converter interfacing with ESE is presented. A single-phase half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter is used in this configuration. Two power management control strategies are applied in this simulation study, load-leveling and load-following procedures. In both strategies, ESE compensates for the difference between the electric drive requirements and the power provided by power distribution bus. Considering some important factors, such as weight, size and durability of the ESE, the load-following control strategy appears to be the most suitable for a regenerative power system in the more electric aircraft.","1558-058X","978-1-4799-6585-4","10.1109/SECON.2014.6950713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950713","","MATLAB;Aircraft;Actuators;DC motors;Force;Military standards","aircraft;aircraft power systems;DC-DC power convertors;electric vehicles;electromechanical actuators;power distribution;rectifiers","regenerative electric power;MEA;more electric aircraft power distribution system;aircraft actuation systems;motor drives;energy storage elements;Simcaps toolbox;aileron model;electro-mechanical actuator;EMA;Matlab;Simulink;regenerative power system;synchronous generator;three-phase-to dc boost rectifier;ESE;single-phase half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter;power management control strategies;load-following procedures;load-leveling procedures;power distribution bus","","11","2","10","IEEE","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
