"Mitigating Coherent Noise by Balancing Weight-2 Z-Stabilizers","J. Hu; Q. Liang; N. Rengaswamy; R.

Stochastic errors in quantum systems occur randomly but coherent errors are more damaging since they can accumulate in a particular direction. We consider coherent noise acting transversally, giving rise to an effective error which is a  $Z$ -rotation on each qubit by some angle  $\theta $ . Rather than address coherent noise through active error correction, we investigate passive mitigation through decoherence free subspaces. In the language of stabilizer codes, we require the noise to preserve the code space, and to act trivially (as the logical identity operator) on the protected information. Thus, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal  $Z$ -rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code. These conditions require the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of the  $X$ -component of some stabilizer. Furthermore, the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes with even block length. By adjusting the sizes of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes oblivious to coherent noise, one that includes the  $[[4L^{2}, 1, 2L]]$  Shor codes. The Shor codes are examples of constant excitation codes, where logical qubits are encoded as a code state that is a sum of physical states indexed by binary vectors with the same weight. Constant excitation codes are oblivious to coherent noise since a transversal  $Z$ -rotation acts as a global phase. We prove that a CSS code is oblivious to coherent noise if and only if it is a constant excitation code, and that if the code is error-detecting, then the (constant) weights in different cosets of the  $X$ -stabilizers are identical.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2021.3130155","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CCF-2106213,CCF-1908730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624967","Coherent noise;decoherence-free subspace (DFS);transversal Z-rotations;necessary conditions;constant excitation code","Codes;Qubit;Computers;Product codes;Stochastic processes;Quantum system;Ions","error correction;error correction codes;parity check codes;quantum communication;quantum computing;stochastic processes","stabilizer code;single-parity-check codes;QECC codes;Shor codes;constant excitation code;code state;coherent noise;balancing weight-2 Z-stabilizers;stochastic errors;code space","","3","","40","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Design of Handheld PTZ Stabilizer Based on Arduino","H. Hua","Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Civil Aviation Flight University of China, Guanghan, China","2023 IEEE 6th Information Technology,Networking,Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)","30 Mar 2023","2023","6","","1600","1604","The handheld stabilized PTZ can eliminate the change of PTZ’s attitude caused by the user’s movement relative to the external environmental parameters. The PTZ stabilizer can enable the object on the carrier platform to achieve attitude stability control, which can automatically keep the camera, mobile phone and other devices stable and balanced during the shooting process, so that the captured images are clearer and the picture quality is better. In this paper, a low-cost, multi-functional, low energy consumption three-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer is designed to solve the problems such as picture shaking of small handheld devices when in motion. The IMU component of the MPU 6050 is used as the angle detection component of the handheld PTZ stabilizer. The Arduino Nano MG996R is used as the microcontroller to process the collected data into angle data, and the PWM signals are outputted by the pins to control the steering gears. The Blender software is used to model and design the 3D model of the PTZ shell, and the Arduino is used to integrate the PTZ control software and hardware, and finally the overall design is optimized. The experiment shows that the design meets the requirement that the carrier coordinate system is stable relative to the geographical coordinate system. Although there is a certain angle error, the overall operation is in good condition. At the same time, it can also suppress the output of a certain axial direction to achieve the function of a two-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer.","2693-3128","978-1-6654-6004-0","10.1109/ITNEC56291.2023.10082408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10082408","three-axis stabilized PTZ;MPU 6050;PID control;Kalman Filter;Arduino Uno development board","Solid modeling;Energy consumption;Three-dimensional displays;Attitude control;Gears;Process control;Information filters","attitude control;cameras;gears;microcontrollers;stability","Arduino NanoMG996R;attitude stability control;handheld devices;low energy consumption three-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer;PTZ shell;PTZ's attitude;two-degree-of-freedom handheld PTZ stabilizer","","","","5","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most of the developing countries, this low cost power generation plays vital role in balancing the energy markets in terms of its economic operation. But, owing to its large installation capacity, the alternators possess huge rating and size. As the rating and the size increases, the machine start and stop procedure pro-longs and hence the term stability is attained after a minimum period of start of generation. This is due to the high inertia constant and in detail due to the lack of synchronization which leads to excessive damping of the entire system. And hence optimal design of the damping coefficient ( KD) is desired in order to bring the system to stability. The KD directly depends on the respective damping coefficient design of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) and the Power System Stabilizers (PSS). A small signal stability experienced by such systems may be due to two reasons a) Due to Electric Dynamics (ED) b) Due to Non-Electric Dynamics (NED). The former is a most common phenomenon and is most widely monitored. But the latter is often discarded in majority of the stability analysis. Earlier studies have pinpoint results on the impacts of NED on the stability of the system. And hence, a joint research analysis on optimal modeling of the damping coefficient and the impacts of NED have scope in the installed systems. The work presented here concentrates on two thing a) optimal model-ling of the KD and later optimally reducing its settling time using constrained optimization technique b) upon the designed value of KD the impact of NED is studied and inference is discussed. The entire work is carried out by taking a large hydro-alternator of 66.67MVA which is installed at a Hydro Electric Generating Station located in India. The alternator is optimally modeled using dynamic equations and then the settling time is further optimized. Later the developed model is taken out for analysis of NED. The work is carried out in MATLAB Simulink Platform.","","978-1-7281-0167-5","10.1109/ICECA.2019.8821829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821829","Damping coefficient (KD);Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR);Power System Stabilizers (PSS);Non-Electric Dynamics (NED);Constraint Optimization","Mathematical model;Damping;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Power system dynamics;Alternators;Aerodynamics","alternators;hydroelectric power stations;Matlab;optimisation;power generation control;power generation economics;power markets;power system simulation;power system stability;synchronisation;voltage control","NED;optimal modeling;settling time;dynamic equations;optimum modelling;energy source;low cost power generation;energy markets;power system stabilizers;signal stability analysis;electric dynamics;nonelectric dynamics;constrained optimization technique;damping coefficient design;hydro alternator;system replacement;economic operation;machine stop procedure;machine start procedure;automatic voltage regulation;India;hydro electric generating station;MATLAB Simulink;apparent power 66.67 MVA","","1","","12","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motion control with respect to stability of dynamically stable mobile manipulators is one the interesting challenges in robotics. Mobile robots with small base are capable of moving in limited space. A Ballbot is an underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. It is as tall as human height until could interact by people whereas a Ballbot has not been equipped with a manipulator for grasping objects. In this paper, it has been equipped with a PUMA type manipulator which gives to the proposed robot the capability of object manipulation. Because of passive joints, Ballbot cannot maintain stability and following desired end-effector trajectory. So, a 2 DOF stabilizing pendulum is used to help the stability of a system and make the manipulator practical. As a result, dynamics equations of the assumed mobile robot are presented. Furthermore, a model-based controller is described to move the end-effector along the desired path/trajectory and maintains the system balance. Obtained results show the capabilities of the proposed control algorithm in satisfying the desired objectives.","","978-1-4673-5811-8","10.1109/ICRoM.2013.6510111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6510111","Ballbot;Mobile Manipulator;Stability;Motion Control","Robots;Motion control","end effectors;manipulator dynamics;mobile robots;motion control;pendulums;stability","dynamics modeling;armed control;mobile manipulator;motion control;mobile robots;nonholonomic dynamic constraints;grasping objects;PUMA type manipulator;object manipulation;passive joints;end-effector trajectory;2 DOF stabilizing pendulum","","3","","15","IEEE","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the ability to perform basic tasks, it is desirable that such robots possess some form of social interface such that users can interact with them in a natural manner. While many robot platforms have been developed to perform everyday tasks, few systems possess high levels of mechanical efficiency, system stability, practical functionality and a dynamic social interface. This work presents the novel design of a humanoid robot that uses wheels for locomotion and the combination of an actuated stabilizer and a self-balancing control algorithm to maintain stability. To validate some of the basic concepts in this design, a full scale working prototype was built and its performance was tested. It was found that despite being the first prototype of its type, it was capable of robust locomotion in indoor environments and was capable of traversing small bumps with relative ease.

UMAP integrates parallel and sequential processing layers which consist of heterogeneous functional IPs for general media contents processing on today's application processors (AP). Based on the heterogeneous many-core platform, UMAP supports not only graphics and vision processing for real-time augmented reality (AR) but also disparity estimation and 3D display synthesis for 3D-view AR acceleration. A new concept of 3D-view AR which synthesizes 3D display contents from two vertically aligned stereo images and a self-constructed disparity map is introduced to achieve true realism for next generation mobile devices. For low-cost 3D-view AR processing, a homography-based disparity estimation (HDE) algorithm is proposed to construct a disparity map between two stereo images with small implementation overhead. For real-time and energy-efficient system organization, workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture and a mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) are also implemented in UMAP. The 3-stage pipelined system which consists of graphics, vision, and display operation stages reduces per-frame execution latency, while dynamic analog/digital mode reconfiguration based on mixed-mode FEE reduces per-frame energy dissipation, so real-time energy-efficient 3D-view AR can be realized in UMAP. FEE performs high-speed corner detection for vision processing based on four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCLs). Especially, a diode-connected current sensing stabilizer (CSS) in each CCL reduces minimum sensing current for corner detection, so average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In 2D or 3D-view AR processing, FEE with four CCLs replaces the parallel processing core cluster which is the most power hungry IP in UMAP, so 96.7% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved in real operation. Based on the 3-stage pipelined architecture with the dynamic mode reconfiguration technique, the entire UMAP achieves up to 64.4% of energy reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art media processors in full operation.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2013.2259042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6518179","Augmented reality (AR);feature extraction;media application processor;mixed-mode;vision;3D display;3D graphics;3D-view AR","Three-dimensional displays;Media;Graphics;Parallel processing;Image analysis;Estimation;Vectors","augmented reality;computer graphics;computer vision;edge detection;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;stereo image processing","unified media application processor;dynamic analog-digital mode reconfiguration;embedded 3D-media contents processing;UMAP;2D image analysis;3D image analysis;image synthesis;parallel processing layer;sequential processing layer;heterogeneous functional IP;media content processing;heterogeneous many-core platform;vision processing;augmented reality;3D display synthesis;3D-view AR acceleration;stereo image;self-constructed disparity map;mobile device;homography-based disparity estimation algorithm;HDE algorithm;energy-efficient system organization;workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture;mixed-mode feature extraction engine;3-stage pipelined system;graphics operation stage;vision operation stage;display operation stage;mixed-mode FEE;per-frame energy dissipation;energy-efficient 3D-view AR;corner detection;analog current contention logic;CCL;diode-connected current sensing stabilizer;CSS;2D-view AR processing;3D-view AR processing;dynamic mode reconfiguration technique;energy reduction","","2","","27","IEEE","22 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
