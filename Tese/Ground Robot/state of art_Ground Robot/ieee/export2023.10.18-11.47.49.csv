"Ball Balancing on a Stewart Platform using Fuzzy Supervisory PID Visual Servo Control","K. Yaovaja","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Sriracha, Kasetsart University, Chonburi, Thailand","2018 5th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concept Theory and Applications (ICAICTA)","22 Nov 2018","2018","","","170","175","In this paper, fuzzy supervisor of PID controller for ball balancing on a Stewart platform (ball and plate system) was implemented. Small-size Stewart platform was built and used for demonstrating the application of the controller. HD web camera was the visual sensor for sensing the ball position. After image processing, by using color threshold and object detection, the ball position was a feedback signal of the controller. In ball balancing control problem, the x-direction and y-direction can be decentralized and are separated into two PID control loops. Conventional PID control might give poor performance due to nonlinearity such as friction and error from the visual tracking. Model-based control design is complicated and could be suffered from modeling uncertainties. Fuzzy controller, which is a nonlinear control, is chosen to resolve the problem. By the way, the PID controller can be enhanced by using a fuzzy supervisory system. By using a few human intuitive rules, from ball speed and ball location, control performance can be improved. Each PID controller gains were adjusted by the fuzzy supervisor. The controller generated the pitch and roll references. The reference signals were transformed to six servo motor set-points by using the inverse kinematics of the platform. PID position controllers were used for the six servo motors. The ball position results showed enhancement by the proposed control system.","","978-1-5386-4804-9","10.1109/ICAICTA.2018.8541349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8541349","Stewart Platform;Fuzzy Supervisory Control;Ball and Plate;Robots;Machine vision","Servomotors;Image color analysis;Cameras;Visualization;Kinematics","control system synthesis;feedback;fuzzy control;manipulator kinematics;nonlinear control systems;object detection;position control;robot vision;servomechanisms;servomotors;three-term control;visual servoing","fuzzy supervisory system;ball speed;ball location;control performance;PID controller gains;fuzzy supervisor;PID position controllers;ball position results;control system;fuzzy supervisory PID visual servo control;plate system;small-size Stewart platform;HD web camera;visual sensor;color threshold;object detection;ball balancing control problem;PID control loops;conventional PID control;visual tracking;model-based control design;fuzzy controller;nonlinear control","","5","","10","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller and Proportional Velocity (PV) is used to control the location of the ball on a plate in X and Y axes. But the major concerns are both classic PID and PV fails to track the ball position accurately due to non-linearity, process parameters variations and uncertainties. The above demerits are overcome by implementing Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) based PID controller. The closed loop reference model is chosen based on desired time domain specifications and by dominant pole placement technique. The gain values of the PID controller are tuned by MRAC to obtain optimal performance. MRAC based PID controller with MIT rule, modified MRAC with MIT approach, and modified MRAC with the Lyapunov rule are implemented in Simulink. The controller's performance on the benchmark Quanser 2 Dof ball balancer system is evaluated in real-time and comparative analysis is made. From the comparison, it is found modified MRAC based Lyapunov approach suppress the overshoot, provides better stability and tracks the system set-point accurately. On the other hand modified MRAC offers less Root Mean Square (RMS) value and faster tracking with less adaptation gain.","","978-1-5386-7269-3","10.1109/ICIAS.2018.8540635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540635","Ball balancer system;MRAC;Lyapunov rule;Modified MRAC;MIT rule","Servomotors;Cameras;Tracking;Real-time systems;Robot vision systems;Transfer functions","closed loop systems;control nonlinearities;control system synthesis;least mean squares methods;Lyapunov methods;machine control;model reference adaptive control systems;nonlinear control systems;position control;servomotors;stability;three-term control;uncertain systems;velocity control;visual servoing","visual servoing;Lyapunov rule;servo motors;ball position;process parameters variations;uncertainties;closed loop reference model;modified MRAC;model reference adaptive control;proportional integral derivative controller;PID controller;nonlinear system;proportional velocity;Quanser 2 Dof ball balancer system;root mean square;RMS value;MIT approach;2 degree of freedom;model reference adaptive controller;PV fails;stability;ball on plate balancing system","","","","13","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a platform to test and identify different aspects of controls, as the non-linearities increases with the degree of freedoms. So far many techniques have been applied to sense the position of the ball on a plate in real time, most common of them is touchpad and audio video camera system. This paper describes the design, development and control strategy of balancing a ball on a plate using low cost phototransistor sensors. These Phototransistors are triggered by monochromatic sharp beams of laser light. The plate area is 1sq. foot and an array of 11 sensors each 1 inch apart is used on each axis making total of 121 points on the plate. To balance the ball, two motors are used one for each axis. The ground motor is fixed, while to control the other axis second motor is fixed on top of the ground motor. Hence the system utilizes two sets of independent control mechanisms, each operating in isolation for each axis. ATMEGA16 microcontroller is used which is an Atmel AVR family controller with a flash memory of 16 kb. Since it has two independently switched PWM channels, therefore, it makes this controller ideal for the purpose. Dynamic modeling of the system yields the digital controller capable of balancing the ball in any of the desired positions out of 121 points, on the plate. Although the system becomes quite discrete but still it provides sufficient basis for implementing different control strategies and investigating different system parameters such as actuation mechanism, sensors, controller design and experimental testing, under the predefined condition of the ball diameter.","2151-1411","978-1-4577-1929-5","10.1109/IBCAST.2012.6177520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177520","","Real time systems;Mobile robots;Variable speed drives;Microcontrollers;Graphical user interfaces;Robot sensing systems","closed loop systems;control nonlinearities;digital control;discrete systems;flash memories;microcontrollers;open loop systems;phototransistors;position control;sensors;servomotors;stability;three-term control","ball-on-plate balancing system;2-degree-of-freedom platform;control system;control nonlinearities;phototransistor sensors;laser light monochromatic sharp beams;ground motor;independent control mechanisms;ATMEGA16 microcontroller;Atmel AVR family controller;flash memory;independently switched PWM channels;system dynamic modeling;digital controller;discrete system;actuation mechanism;controller design;experimental testing;open loop unstable system;servo control system;closed loop position control;PID control","","20","","10","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A single HD camera module is used as a sensor to detect the ball's position and two RC servo motors are used to tilt the plate to balance the ball.

The data errors obtained by the inertial devices will accumulate over time, and the long-term pose estimation is rather unreliable. But for some quick motion over a short period of time, inertial sensors can get very accurate estimates. Monocular cameras are often used as image real-time monitoring sensors by single ball self-balancing mobile robots. The camera's data does not accumulate errors over time, so there is essentially no drift. Therefore, camera pose estimation can effectively correct the inertial sensor error. In a fast-moving environment, the shutter-roller camera cannot capture the image clearly and there may be ghosting or overlapping of two areas too little, resulting in mismatched or unmatched conditions. So that the robot makes a wrong estimate. In this paper, the non-linear optimization method is used to fuse the IMU and monocular attitude data to obtain the optimal pose estimation of the robot. Based on the modeling of robot using Lagrange's equation method, the control of single ball robot is realized by using fuzzy PID algorithm. Experiments show that this scheme can respond quickly to the change of the attitude of the ball self-balancing robot and keep the attitude of the robot relatively stationary, so that the robot can move steadily.","1934-1768","978-988-15639-5-8","10.23919/ChiCC.2018.8483731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8483731","Ball self-balancing robot;Attitude detection;Nonlicear optimization;Visual inertial data fusion","Mobile robots;Robot kinematics;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Mathematical model","cameras;fuzzy control;inertial navigation;mobile robots;nonlinear programming;pose estimation;robot vision;three-term control","ball self-balancing robot;single ball self-balancing mobile robot;static instability system;IMU inertial devices;long-term pose estimation;inertial sensors;real-time monitoring sensors;inertial sensor error;single ball robot;Pose optimization;camera pose estimation;shutter-roller camera;non-linear optimization;Lagrange's equation method;fuzzy PID algorithm","","1","","22","","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the system is to levitate a metallic ball at a determined height under the influence of magnetic force by the principle of non-contact. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to develop a controller to regulate the nonlinear dynamics in the magnetic levitation system. The proposed technique acts in parallel with a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller to balance the position of levitating ball in the air. Here, the optimization technique tunes the gain values of the PID controller for achieving better performance measures when applied to a nonlinear system. This tuning process adheres to search the optimal solution with the help of agents called as particles whose trajectories are adjusted by a deterministic component. Each particle is optimized by its best-achieved position through the iterative approach. Further, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through simulation as well as on hardware. Both PID and PSO tuned PID controllers were designed and the dynamics of magnetic levitation system were tested. The results validate the performance of both conventional PID controller as well as PSO tuned PID controller enhancing the operation of the magnetic levitation system. It is observed that the PSO tuned PID overcomes the drawback of conventional PID by optimizing the performance parameters such as steady-state error and settling time.","","978-1-7281-4108-4","10.1109/ICESC48915.2020.9155772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155772","Particle swarm optimization (PSO);Zeigler Nicholas (Z-N) method;PID controller;Linear quadratic regulator (LQR);Magnetic levitation system (MLS)","Magnetic levitation;Magnetic forces;Particle swarm optimization;Electromagnetics;Mathematical model;Metals;Optimization","magnetic levitation;optimisation;particle swarm optimisation;position control;three-term control","magnetic levitation system;second-order nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization technique;proportional integral derivative controller;levitating ball;optimization technique tunes;PID controller;ball position control","","4","","18","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since these robots have two controllable degrees of freedom (DOFs), they can rotate about any point, but cannot perform immediate motion in every direction. To overcome this type of motion limitation, omnidirectional mobile robots were proposed. They can move in an arbitrary direction without changing the direction of the wheels, because they can achieve five DOF-motion on a two dimensional plane. A special kind of such a robot is a Ball-Balancing Robot (BBR). This system is inherently unstable, as it will immediately fall down when no active control is applied to the wheels on the ball. There is no need to rotate the robot body when change the driving direction of the ball robot, so it is suitable for cluttered environments. The proposed work is intended to be used as an assistant robot in offices, airports, shopping complexes where there is a lot of congestion in the surroundings. It is also equipped with a kinect sensor for providing vision capabilities using which it could simultaneously localize itself and map its surroundings (SLAM) that would result in a seamless motion.

The purpose of linearization is to find a linear function (a set of linear functions) to describe the dynamics of the nonlinear model at a given operating condition. In order to understand how the linearization is performed, the chapter examines the case of linearization of a nonlinear function.

The inverse kinematics are approximated using the Jacobian pseudo-inverse method. The control of the motion of a robot is introduced using the versatile PID controller.
